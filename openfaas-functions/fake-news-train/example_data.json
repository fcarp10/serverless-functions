{"x_dict": {"0": "Daniel Greenfield, a Shillman Journalism Fellow at the Freedom Center, is a New York writer focusing on radical Islam. \nIn the final stretch of the election, Hillary Rodham Clinton has gone to war with the FBI. \nThe word \u201cunprecedented\u201d has been thrown around so often this election that it ought to be retired. But it\u2019s still unprecedented for the nominee of a major political party to go war with the FBI. \nBut that\u2019s exactly what Hillary and her people have done. Coma patients just waking up now and watching an hour of CNN from their hospital beds would assume that FBI Director James Comey is Hillary\u2019s opponent in this election. \nThe FBI is under attack by everyone from Obama to CNN. Hillary\u2019s people have circulated a letter attacking Comey. There are currently more media hit pieces lambasting him than targeting Trump. It wouldn\u2019t be too surprising if the Clintons or their allies were to start running attack ads against the FBI. \nThe FBI\u2019s leadership is being warned that the entire left-wing establishment will form a lynch mob if they continue going after Hillary. And the FBI\u2019s credibility is being attacked by the media and the Democrats to preemptively head off the results of the investigation of the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton. \nThe covert struggle between FBI agents and Obama\u2019s DOJ people has gone explosively public. \nThe New York Times has compared Comey to J. Edgar Hoover. Its bizarre headline, \u201cJames Comey Role Recalls Hoover\u2019s FBI, Fairly or Not\u201d practically admits up front that it\u2019s spouting nonsense. The Boston Globe has published a column calling for Comey\u2019s resignation. Not to be outdone, Time has an editorial claiming that the scandal is really an attack on all women. \nJames Carville appeared on MSNBC to remind everyone that he was still alive and insane. He accused Comey of coordinating with House Republicans and the KGB. And you thought the \u201cvast right wing conspiracy\u201d was a stretch. \nCountless media stories charge Comey with violating procedure. Do you know what\u2019s a procedural violation? Emailing classified information stored on your bathroom server. \nSenator Harry Reid has sent Comey a letter accusing him of violating the Hatch Act. The Hatch Act is a nice idea that has as much relevance in the age of Obama as the Tenth Amendment. But the cable news spectrum quickly filled with media hacks glancing at the Wikipedia article on the Hatch Act under the table while accusing the FBI director of one of the most awkward conspiracies against Hillary ever. \nIf James Comey is really out to hurt Hillary, he picked one hell of a strange way to do it. \nNot too long ago Democrats were breathing a sigh of relief when he gave Hillary Clinton a pass in a prominent public statement. If he really were out to elect Trump by keeping the email scandal going, why did he trash the investigation? Was he on the payroll of House Republicans and the KGB back then and playing it coy or was it a sudden development where Vladimir Putin and Paul Ryan talked him into taking a look at Anthony Weiner\u2019s computer? \nEither Comey is the most cunning FBI director that ever lived or he\u2019s just awkwardly trying to navigate a political mess that has trapped him between a DOJ leadership whose political futures are tied to Hillary\u2019s victory and his own bureau whose apolitical agents just want to be allowed to do their jobs. \nThe only truly mysterious thing is why Hillary and her associates decided to go to war with a respected Federal agency. Most Americans like the FBI while Hillary Clinton enjoys a 60% unfavorable rating. \nAnd it\u2019s an interesting question. \nHillary\u2019s old strategy was to lie and deny that the FBI even had a criminal investigation underway. Instead her associates insisted that it was a security review. The FBI corrected her and she shrugged it off. But the old breezy denial approach has given way to a savage assault on the FBI. \nPretending that nothing was wrong was a bad strategy, but it was a better one that picking a fight with the FBI while lunatic Clinton associates try to claim that the FBI is really the KGB. \nThere are two possible explanations. \nHillary Clinton might be arrogant enough to lash out at the FBI now that she believes that victory is near. The same kind of hubris that led her to plan her victory fireworks display could lead her to declare a war on the FBI for irritating her during the final miles of her campaign. \nBut the other explanation is that her people panicked. \nGoing to war with the FBI is not the behavior of a smart and focused presidential campaign. It\u2019s an act of desperation. When a presidential candidate decides that her only option is to try and destroy the credibility of the FBI, that\u2019s not hubris, it\u2019s fear of what the FBI might be about to reveal about her. \nDuring the original FBI investigation, Hillary Clinton was confident that she could ride it out. And she had good reason for believing that. But that Hillary Clinton is gone. In her place is a paranoid wreck. Within a short space of time the \u201cpositive\u201d Clinton campaign promising to unite the country has been replaced by a desperate and flailing operation that has focused all its energy on fighting the FBI. \nThere\u2019s only one reason for such bizarre behavior. \nThe Clinton campaign has decided that an FBI investigation of the latest batch of emails poses a threat to its survival. And so it\u2019s gone all in on fighting the FBI. It\u2019s an unprecedented step born of fear. It\u2019s hard to know whether that fear is justified. But the existence of that fear already tells us a whole lot. \nClinton loyalists rigged the old investigation. They knew the outcome ahead of time as well as they knew the debate questions. Now suddenly they are no longer in control. And they are afraid. \nYou can smell the fear. \nThe FBI has wiretaps from the investigation of the Clinton Foundation. It\u2019s finding new emails all the time. And Clintonworld panicked. The spinmeisters of Clintonworld have claimed that the email scandal is just so much smoke without fire. All that\u2019s here is the appearance of impropriety without any of the substance. But this isn\u2019t how you react to smoke. It\u2019s how you respond to a fire. \nThe misguided assault on the FBI tells us that Hillary Clinton and her allies are afraid of a revelation bigger than the fundamental illegality of her email setup. The email setup was a preemptive cover up. The Clinton campaign has panicked badly out of the belief, right or wrong, that whatever crime the illegal setup was meant to cover up is at risk of being exposed. \nThe Clintons have weathered countless scandals over the years. Whatever they are protecting this time around is bigger than the usual corruption, bribery, sexual assaults and abuses of power that have followed them around throughout the years. This is bigger and more damaging than any of the allegations that have already come out. And they don\u2019t want FBI investigators anywhere near it. \nThe campaign against Comey is pure intimidation. It\u2019s also a warning. Any senior FBI people who value their careers are being warned to stay away. The Democrats are closing ranks around their nominee against the FBI. It\u2019s an ugly and unprecedented scene. It may also be their last stand. \nHillary Clinton has awkwardly wound her way through numerous scandals in just this election cycle. But she\u2019s never shown fear or desperation before. Now that has changed. Whatever she is afraid of, it lies buried in her emails with Huma Abedin. And it can bring her down like nothing else has.

And Paul Ryan will never be president. Today proved it. \nIn a particularly staggering example of political cowardice, Paul Ryan re-re-re-reversed course and announced that he was back on the Trump Train after all. This was an aboutface from where he was a few weeks ago. He had previously declared he would not be supporting or defending Trump after a tape was made public in which Trump bragged about assaulting women. Suddenly, Ryan was appearing at a pro-Trump rally and boldly declaring that he already sent in his vote to make him President of the United States. It was a surreal moment. The figurehead of the Republican Party dosed himself in gasoline, got up on a stage on a chilly afternoon in Wisconsin, and lit a match. . @SpeakerRyan says he voted for @realDonaldTrump : \u201cRepublicans, it is time to come home\u201d https://t.co/VyTT49YvoE pic.twitter.com/wCvSCg4a5I \n\u2014 ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) November 5, 2016 \nThe Democratic Party couldn\u2019t have asked for a better moment of film. Ryan\u2019s chances of ever becoming president went down to zero in an instant. In the wreckage Trump is to leave behind in his wake, those who cravenly backed his campaign will not recover. If Ryan\u2019s career manages to limp all the way to 2020, then the DNC will have this tape locked and loaded to be used in every ad until Election Day. \nThe ringing endorsement of the man he clearly hates on a personal level speaks volumes about his own spinelessness. Ryan has postured himself as a \u201cprincipled\u201d conservative, and one uncomfortable with Trump\u2019s unapologetic bigotry and sexism. However, when push came to shove, Paul Ryan \u2013 like many of his colleagues \u2013 turned into a sniveling appeaser. After all his lofty tak about conviction, his principles were a house of cards and collapsed with the slightest breeze. \nWhat\u2019s especially bizarre is how close Ryan came to making it through unscathed. For months the Speaker of the House refused to comment on Trump at all. His strategy seemed to be to keep his head down, pretend Trump didn\u2019t exist, and hope that nobody remembered what happened in 2016. Now, just days away from the election, he screwed it all up. \nIf 2016\u2019s very ugly election has done any good it\u2019s by exposing the utter cowardice of the Republicans who once feigned moral courage. A reality television star spit on them, hijacked their party, insulted their wives, and got every last one of them to kneel before him.

Kerry said Monday that he will stop in Paris later this week, amid criticism that no top American officials attended Sunday\u2019s unity march against terrorism.\n\nKerry said he expects to arrive in Paris Thursday evening, as he heads home after a week abroad. He said he will fly to France at the conclusion of a series of meetings scheduled for Thursday in Sofia, Bulgaria. He plans to meet the next day with Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and President Francois Hollande, then return to Washington.\n\nThe visit by Kerry, who has family and childhood ties to the country and speaks fluent French, could address some of the criticism that the United States snubbed France in its darkest hour in many years.\n\nThe French press on Monday was filled with questions about why neither President Obama nor Kerry attended Sunday\u2019s march, as about 40 leaders of other nations did. Obama was said to have stayed away because his own security needs can be taxing on a country, and Kerry had prior commitments.\n\nAmong roughly 40 leaders who did attend was Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, no stranger to intense security, who marched beside Hollande through the city streets. The highest ranking U.S. officials attending the march were Jane Hartley, the ambassador to France, and Victoria Nuland, the assistant secretary of state for European affairs. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. was in Paris for meetings with law enforcement officials but did not participate in the march.\n\nKerry spent Sunday at a business summit hosted by India\u2019s prime minister, Narendra Modi. The United States is eager for India to relax stringent laws that function as barriers to foreign investment and hopes Modi\u2019s government will act to open the huge Indian market for more American businesses.\n\nIn a news conference, Kerry brushed aside criticism that the United States had not sent a more senior official to Paris as \u201cquibbling a little bit.\u201d He noted that many staffers of the American Embassy in Paris attended the march, including the ambassador. He said he had wanted to be present at the march himself but could not because of his prior commitments in India.\n\n\u201cBut that is why I am going there on the way home, to make it crystal clear how passionately we feel about the events that have taken place there,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cAnd I don\u2019t think the people of France have any doubts about America\u2019s understanding of what happened, of our personal sense of loss and our deep commitment to the people of France in this moment of trauma.\u201d", "3": "\u2014 Kaydee King (@KaydeeKing) November 9, 2016 The lesson from tonight's Dem losses: Time for Democrats to start listening to the voters.

More than 50 years ago, they arrived in New York City from Iran. I grew up mainly in central New Jersey, an American kid playing little league for the Raritan Red Sox and soccer for the Raritan Rovers. In 1985, I travelled with my family to our ancestral land. I was only eight, but old enough to understand that the Iranians had lost their liberty and freedom. I saw the abject despair of a people who, in a desperate attempt to bring about change, had ushered in nationalist tyrants led by Ayatollah Khomeini. \nWhat I witnessed during that year in Iran changed the course of my life. In 1996, at age 19, wanting to help preserve the blessings of liberty and freedom we enjoy in America, I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. Now, with the rise of Donald Trump and his nationalist alt-right movement, I\u2019ve come to feel that the values I sought to protect are in jeopardy. \nIn Iran, theocratic fundmentalists sowed division and hatred of outsiders \u2014 of Westerners, Christians, and other religious minorities. Here in America, the right wing seems to have stolen passages directly from their playbook as it spreads hatred of immigrants, particularly Muslim ones. This form of nationalistic bigotry \u2014 Islamophobia \u2014 threatens the heart of our nation. When I chose to serve in the military, I did so to protect what I viewed as our sacred foundational values of liberty, equality, and democracy. Now, 20 years later, I\u2019ve joined forces with fellow veterans to again fight for those sacred values, this time right here at home. \n\u201cDeath to America!\u201d \nAs a child, I sat in my class at the international school one sunny morning and heard in the distance the faint sounds of gunfire and rising chants of \u201cDeath to America!\u201d That day would define the rest of my life. \nIt was Tehran, the capital of Iran, in 1985. I was attending a unique school for bilingual students who had been born in Western nations. It had become the last refuge in that city with any tolerance for Western teaching, but that also made it a target for military fundamentalists. As the gunfire drew closer, I heard boots pounding the marble tiles outside, marching into our building, and thundering down the corridor toward my classroom. As I heard voices chanting \u201cDeath to America!\u201d I remember wondering if I would survive to see my parents again. \nIn a flash of green and black uniforms, those soldiers rushed into our classroom, grabbed us by our shirt collars, and yelled at us to get outside. We were then packed into the school\u2019s courtyard where a soldier pointed his rifle at our group and commanded us to look up. Almost in unison, my classmates and I raised our eyes and saw the flags of our many nations being torn down and dangled from the balcony, then set ablaze and tossed, still burning, into the courtyard. As those flags floated to the ground in flames, the soldiers fired their guns in the air. Shouting, they ordered us \u2014 if we ever wanted to see our families again \u2014 to swear allegiance to the Grand Ayatollah Khomeini and trample on the remains of the burning symbols of our home countries. I scanned the smoke that was filling the courtyard for my friends and classmates and, horrified, watched them capitulate and begin to chant, \u201cDeath to America!\u201d as they stomped on our sacred symbols. \nI was so angry that, young as I was, I began to plead with them to come to their senses. No one paid the slightest attention to an eight year old and yet, for the first time in my life, I felt something like righteous indignation. I suspect that, born and raised in America, I was already imbued with such a sense of privilege that I just couldn\u2019t fathom the immense danger I was in. Certainly, I was acting in ways no native Iranian would have found reasonable. \nAcross the smoke-filled courtyard, I saw a soldier coming at me and knew he meant to force me to submit. I spotted an American flag still burning, dropped to my knees, and grabbed the charred pieces from underneath a classmate\u2019s feet. As the soldier closed in on me, I ducked and ran, still clutching my charred pieces of flag into a crowd of civilians who had gathered to witness the commotion. The events of that day would come to define all that I have ever stood for \u2014 or against. \n\u201cCamel Jockey,\u201d \u201cAyatollah,\u201d and \u201cGandhi\u201d \nMy parents and I soon returned to the United States and I entered third grade. More than anything, I just wanted to be normal, to fit in and be accepted by my peers. Unfortunately, my first name, Nader (which I changed to Nate upon joining the Navy), and my swarthy Middle Eastern appearance, were little help on that score, eliciting regular jibes from my classmates. Even at that young age, they had already mastered a veritable thesaurus of ethnic defamation, including \u201ccamel jockey,\u201d \u201csand-nigger,\u201d \u201craghead,\u201d \u201cayatollah,\u201d and ironically, \u201cGandhi\u201d (which I now take as a compliment). My classmates regularly sought to \u201cother-ize\u201d me in those years, as if I were a lesser American because of my faith and ethnicity. \nYet I remember that tingling in my chest when I first donned my Cub Scout uniform \u2014 all because of the American flag patch on its shoulder. Something felt so good about wearing it, a feeling I still had when I joined the military. It seems that the flag I tried to rescue in Tehran was stapled to my heart, or that\u2019s how I felt anyway as I wore my country\u2019s uniform. \nWhen I took my oath of enlistment in the U.S. Navy, I gave my mom a camera and asked her to take some photos, but she was so overwhelmed with pride and joy that she cried throughout the ceremony and managed to snap only a few images of the carpet. She cried even harder when I was selected to serve as the first Muslim-American member of the U.S. Navy Presidential Ceremonial Honor Guard . On that day, I was proud, too, and all the taunts of those bullies of my childhood seemed finally silenced. \nBeing tormented because of my ethnicity and religion in those early years had another effect on me. It caused me to become unusually sensitive to the nature of other people. Somehow, I grasped that, if it weren\u2019t for a fear of the unknown, there was an inherent goodness and frail humanity lurking in many of the kids who bullied and harassed me. Often, I discovered, those same bullies could be tremendously kind to their families, friends, or even strangers. I realized, then, that if, despite everything, I could lay myself bare and trust them enough to reach out in kindness, I might in turn gain their trust and they might then see me, too, and stop operating from such a place of fear and hate. \nThrough patience, humor, and understanding, I was able to offer myself as the embodiment of my people and somehow defang the \u201cotherness\u201d of so much that Americans found scary. To this day, I have friends from elementary school, middle school, high school, and the military who tell me that I am the only Muslim they have ever known and that, had they not met me, their perspective on Islam would have been wholly subject to the prevailing fear-based narrative that has poisoned this country since September 11, 2001. \nIn 1998, I became special assistant to the Master Chief Petty Officer of the Navy and then, in 1999, I was recruited to serve at the Defense Intelligence Agency. In August 2000, I transferred to the Naval Reserve. \nIn the wake of 9/11, I began to observe how so many of my fellow Americans were adopting a fundamentalist \u201cus vs. them\u201d attitude towards Muslims and Islam. I suddenly found myself in an America where the scattered insults I had endured as a child took on an overarching and sinister meaning and form, where they became something like an ideology and way of life. \nBy the time I completed my military service in 2006, I had begun to understand that our policies in the Middle East,similarly disturbed, seemed in pursuit of little more than perpetual warfare. That, in turn, was made possible by the creation of a new enemy: Islam \u2014 or rather of a portrait, painted by the powers-that-be, of Islam as a terror religion, as a hooded villain lurking out there somewhere in the desert, waiting to destroy us. I knew that attempting to dispel, through the patient approach of my childhood, the kind of Islamophobia that now had the country by the throat was not going to be enough. Post-9/11 attacks on Muslims in the U.S. and elsewhere were not merely childish taunts. \nFor the first time in my life, in a country gripped by fear, I believed I was witnessing a shift, en masse, toward an American fundamentalism and ultra-nationalism that reflected a wanton lack of reason, not to mention fact. As a boy in Iran, I had witnessed the dark destination down which such a path could take a country. Now, it seemed to me, in America\u2019s quest to escape the very demons we had sown by our own misadventures in the Middle East, and forsaking the hallmarks of our founding, we risked becoming everything we sought to defeat. \nThe Boy in the Schoolyard Grown Up \nOn February 10, 2015, three young American students, Yusor Abu-Salha, Razan Abu-Salha, and Deah Shaddy Barakat, were executed at an apartment complex in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. The killer was a gun-crazy white man filled with hate and described by his own daughter as \u201ca monster.\u201d Those assassinations struck a special chord of sorrow and loss in me. My mom and I cried and prayed together for those students and their families. \nThe incident in Chapel Hill also awoke in me some version of the righteous indignation I had felt so many years earlier in that smoke-filled courtyard in Iran. I would be damned if I stood by while kids in my country were murdered simply because of their faith. It violated every word of the oath I had taken when I joined the military and desecrated every value I held in my heart as a sacred tenet of our nation. White nationalists and bigots had, by then, thrown down the gauntlet for so much of this, using Islamophobia to trigger targeted assassinations in the United States. This was terrorism, pure and simple, inspired by hate-speakers here at home. \nAt that moment, I reached out to fellow veterans who, I thought, might be willing to help \u2014 and it\u2019s true what they say about soul mates being irrevocably drawn to each other. When I contacted Veterans For Peace , an organization dedicated to exposing the costs of war and militarism, I found the leadership well aware of the inherent dangers of Islamophobia and of the need to confront this new enemy. So Executive Director Michael McPhearson formed a committee of vets from around the country to decide how those of us who had donned uniforms to defend this land could best battle the phenomenon \u2014 and I, of course, joined it. \nFrom that committee emerged Veterans Challenge Islamophobia (VCI). It now has organizers in Arizona, Georgia, New Jersey, and Texas, and that\u2019s just a beginning. Totally nonpartisan, VCI focuses on politicians of any party who engage in hate speech. We\u2019ve met with leaders of American Muslim communities, sat with them through Ramadan, and attended their Iftar dinners to break our fasts together. In the wake of the Orlando shooting , we at VCI also mobilized to fight back against attempts to pit the Muslim community against the LGBTQ+ community. \nOur group was born of the belief that, as American military veterans, we had a responsibility to call out bigotry, hatred, and the perpetuation of endless warfare. We want the American Muslim community to know that they have allies, and that those allies are indeed veterans as well. We stand with them and for them and, for those of us who are Muslim, among them. \nNationalism and xenophobia have no place in American life, and I, for my part, don\u2019t think Donald Trump or anyone like him should be able to peddle Islamophobia in an attempt to undermine our national unity. Without Islamophobia, there no longer exists a \u201cclash of civilizations.\u201d Without Islamophobia, whatever the problems in the world may be, there is no longer an \u201cus vs. them\u201d and it\u2019s possible to begin reimagining a world of something other than perpetual war. \nAs of now, this remains the struggle of my life, for despite my intense love for America, some of my countrymen increasingly see American Muslims as the \u201cother,\u201d the enemy. \nMy Mom taught me as a boy that the only thing that mattered was what was in my heart. Now, with her in mind and as a representative of VCI, when I meet fellow Americans I always remember my childhood experiences with my bullying peers. And I still lay myself bare, as I did then. I give trust to gain trust, but always knowing that these days this isn\u2019t just a matter of niceties. It\u2019s a question of life or death. It\u2019s part of a battle for the soul of our nation. \nIn many ways, I still consider myself that boy in the school courtyard in Tehran trying to rescue charred pieces of that flag from those trampling feet. It\u2019s just that now I\u2019m doing it in my own country. \nNate Terani is a veteran of the U.S. Navy and served in military intelligence with the Defense Intelligence Agency.

The intruders didn\u2019t seem to know or care that FaceTime was still on and Baylee\u2019s face, seen in the corner, was watching everything, terrified that she was about to see her boyfriend murdered in front of her, as she watched him fight for his life. \nAdmitting that she first thought it was a joke, seconds later, she came to the horrid realization that he was being robbed and called her dad, who was at home with her in Dallas, into the room. \u201cI was scared, because they were saying I\u2019m going to blow your head off, I\u2019m going to kill you,\u201d Baylee explained along with the chilling feeling she got when the intruder finally realized the video chat was running and looked right at her in the camera. \u201cI\u2019m like wow\u2026 seriously watching an armed robbery happen to somebody that I care about,\u201d she added. Screengrabs of intruder forcing Yale down on his bed while Baylee and her father watch on FaceTime in horror \nWith a clear view of at least one intruder\u2019s face, Baylee began taking screenshots of the suspect in the act as she and her dad called the police to report what was going on. She got the pictures right in time since, seconds later, the intruder decided to disconnect the computer as he and the suspects took off with thousands of dollars worth of Yale\u2019s music equipment. Although the boyfriend\u2019s life was spared in the traumatizing ordeal for the two of them, he said that the thieves took something from him that can\u2019t be replaced. \n\u201cI had just finished my first album as a solo artist,\u201d Yale said. \u201cThat\u2019s all lost,\u201d since they took the recordings on the equipment, which means nothing to the thieves and everything to the victim. It\u2019s not often that you hear of FaceTime solving crimes or potentially saving lives, which is what happened in this case. Although it was difficult to watch, Baylee, being there through technology, was an instrumental part in protecting Yale, who hopefully learned that he better take advantage of Texas\u2019 great gun laws and arm himself with more than just a computer.", "7": "A Czech stockbroker who saved more than 650 Jewish children from Nazi Germany has died at the age of 106. Dubbed \u201cBritain\u2019s Schindler,\u201d Nicholas Winton arranged to transport Jewish youngsters from Prague after Germany annexed Czechoslovakia in March 1939. Though the children were originally set to arrive in Britain by plane, the German invasion forced Winton to transport them by train through Germany before they eventually reached England by boat. Winton arranged eight trains, known as the Kindertransports (children\u2019s transports), to evacuate the children, and died on the anniversary of the 1939 departure of the one carrying the largest number of children: 241. Winton was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2003 for his efforts, despite keeping it secret for nearly 50 years.", "8": "Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump made some inaccurate claims during an NBC \u201ccommander-in-chief\u201d forum on military and veterans issues:\n\n\u2022 Clinton wrongly claimed Trump supported the war in Iraq after it started, while Trump was wrong, once again, in saying he was against the war before it started.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Trump said that President Obama set a \u201ccertain date\u201d for withdrawing troops from Iraq, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Trump said that Obama\u2019s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were \u201cthe first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force One\u201d when \u201chigh officials\u201d of a host country did not appear to greet the president. Not true.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Clinton said that Trump supports privatizing the Veterans Health Administration. That\u2019s false. Trump said he supports allowing veterans to seek care at either public or private hospitals.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Trump said Clinton made \u201ca terrible mistake on Libya\u201d when she was secretary of State. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.\n\n\u2022\u00a0Trump cherry-picked Clinton\u2019s words when he claimed Clinton said \u201cvets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\u201d Clinton had said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as \u201cwidespread\u201d as some Republicans claimed, but she went on to acknowledge problems, including the issue of wait times for doctors.\n\nThe forum, sponsored by NBC News and the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, was held Sept. 7 at the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum in New York City. Today\u00a0show host Matt Lauer, and members of the military and veterans in the audience, questioned the candidates separately.\n\nTrump said he \u201cwas totally against the war in Iraq,\u201d while Clinton claimed that he supported the Iraq War before and after it started. The facts don\u2019t support either candidate\u2019s strong assertions.\n\nOur review of Trump\u2019s statements before and after the Iraq War started found no evidence that Trump opposed the war before it started. In fact, he expressed mild support for invading Iraq when asked about it on the Howard Stern radio show on Sept. 11, 2002 \u2014 about six months before the war started.\n\nStern asked Trump if he supported a war with Iraq, and Trump responded, \u201cYeah, I guess so.\u201d\n\nIn the NBC commander in chief forum, Trump cited an Esquire article that appeared in August 2004 to show his opposition to the war. But that article appeared 17 months after the war started.\n\nAs for Clinton, who as a senator voted in October 2002 to authorize the war in Iraq, the Democratic nominee claimed that Trump \u201csupported it before it happened, he supported it as it was happening and he is on record as supporting it after it happened.\u201d\n\nBut just as there is no evidence that Trump opposed the Iraq War before it started, the Clinton campaign offered no evidence that Trump supported the war \u201cafter it happened.\u201d\n\nThe Clinton campaign cited Trump\u2019s interview on March 21, 2003, with Neil Cavuto of Fox Business just two days after the war started.\n\nCavuto asked Trump about the impact of the war on the stock market. Trump said the war \u201clooks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint,\u201d and he predicted the market will \u201cgo up like a rocket\u201d after the war. But Cavuto does not ask Trump whether the U.S. should have gone to war with Iraq or whether he supports the war, and Trump doesn\u2019t offer an opinion.\n\nAs early as July 2003, Trump expressed concern on Hardball with Chris Matthews\u00a0about money being spent in Iraq rather than in the U.S. Two months later, Trump told MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough, \u201cI guess maybe if I had to do it, I would have fought terrorism but not necessarily Iraq.\u201d\n\nClinton invited her audience to read Trump\u2019s comments on the Iraq War. They can read our timeline, \u201cDonald Trump and the Iraq War.\u201d\n\nTrump said President Obama set a \u201ccertain date\u201d for withdrawing troops from Iraq, but that date was actually set by President George W. Bush.\n\nNBC\u2019s Matt Lauer asked Trump about his tendency to respond, when pushed for details on his military proposals, that he\u2019s not going to give details because he wants to be \u201cunpredictable.\u201d Trump responded, \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d and went on to criticize Obama for revealing the withdrawal date.\n\nAs we said then, Republicans and Democrats disagree on whether Obama or Bush is to blame for withdrawing all combat troops from Iraq at the end of 2011. But that date was set when Bush signed the Status of Forces Agreement on Dec. 14, 2008. It said: \u201cAll the United States Forces shall withdraw from all Iraqi territory no later than December 31, 2011.\u201d\n\nIn the NBC forum, Trump also called the withdrawal of troops \u201ca terrible decision.\u201d As we\u2019ve explained before, Condoleezza Rice, Bush\u2019s secretary of State, later wrote that Bush wanted an agreement for a residual force to remain, but Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki objected.\n\nOnce Obama took office in January 2009, he had three years to renegotiate the deal, which his administration tried to do, to leave a residual American troop force. But Maliki still didn\u2019t agree. Negotiations broke down in October 2011 over the issue of whether U.S. troops would be shielded from criminal prosecution by Iraqi authorities. Whether Obama did enough is a matter of opinion: His then defense secretary, Leon Panetta, later wrote that the president didn\u2019t press hard enough for a deal. But some experts say Iraq was more closely aligned at the time with Iran and there wasn\u2019t a deal to be made with Maliki.\n\nSo, both presidents had a role in the withdrawal of troops. But Trump wrongly said that Obama was the one who set a \u201ccertain date\u201d for withdrawal and let U.S. enemies know about it, when that date was set before Obama was sworn in.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that Trump said in a March 16, 2007, interview on CNN that the troops should be withdrawn quickly from Iraq.\n\nTrump said that Obama\u2019s visits to China, Saudi Arabia and Cuba were \u201cthe first time in the history, the storied history of Air Force One\u201d when \u201chigh officials\u201d of a host country did not appear to greet the president.\n\nThat\u2019s not true. Other presidents have encountered similar low-key greetings on foreign trips aboard the presidential aircraft.\n\nTrump referred to the fact that Cuba\u2019s president, Raul Castro, did not greet Obama at the airport on his historic visit to Cuba in March, that Saudi Arabia\u2019s King Salman did not meet Air Force One at the start of Obama\u2019s trip to Riyadh in April, and he referred to China\u2019s handling of the president\u2019s arrival in Hangzhou last Saturday for a Group of 20 meeting.\n\nWhether or not those arrivals constituted snubs of a U.S. president as Trump claims is a matter of debate. But Trump is wrong on the facts when he claims it has not happened before. It has.\n\nIn 1984, for example, Ronald Reagan landed in Beijing and was received by China\u2019s foreign minister rather than the president, whom he met only later. Similarly, on a 1985 trip to West Germany, Reagan was met by the foreign minister and not Chancellor Helmut Kohl.\n\nThese and other examples were dug up by our friend Glenn Kessler, the Washington Post\u2018s \u201cFact Checker,\u201d who researched a Trump claim in April that Cuba\u2019s and Saudi Arabia\u2019s handling of Obama\u2019s visits were \u201cwithout precedent.\u201d Kessler said of Trump, \u201conce again he\u2019s wrong, wrong, wrong.\u201d\n\nKessler also noted that during Richard Nixon\u2019s historic 1972 visit to China he was greeted at the airport by the country\u2019s number two man, Premier Zhou Enlai. His boss, Chairman Mao, didn\u2019t even agree to meet with Nixon until after he had arrived at a guest house.\n\nClinton said that her plan to overhaul the Veterans Health Administration would not include privatization, which she said Trump supports.\n\nBut Trump refuted that statement when it was his turn to discuss his plan to help veterans. \u201cI would not do that,\u201d Trump said, referring to Clinton\u2019s claim that he supports privatization.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign published \u201cThe Goals Of Donald J. Trump\u2019s Veterans Plan\u201d on its website last October. It doesn\u2019t call for the VA to be completely privatized.\n\nOne of the biggest changes that plan would make to the current VA health care system is allowing veterans to get care at any non-VA medical center that accepts Medicare.\n\n\u201cUnder a Trump Administration, all veterans eligible for VA health care can bring their veteran\u2019s ID card to any doctor or care facility that accepts Medicare to get the care they need immediately,\u201d the plan states.\n\n\u201cThe power to choose will stop the wait time backlogs and force the VA to improve and compete if the department wants to keep receiving veterans\u2019 healthcare dollars,\u201d the plan says.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal would seemingly go further than the Non-VA Medical Care Program, which allows eligible veterans to access care outside of the VA under certain circumstances, such as when VA medical centers cannot provide services. The program requires pre-approval for veterans to receive care at a non-VA facility in non-emergency situations.\n\nTrump\u2019s proposal would also go further than the bipartisan Veterans Choice Act of 2014 that President Obama signed into law, creating a temporary program, separate from the Non-VA Medical Care Program, that allows eligible veterans to receive health care at a non-VA facility if they would have to wait more than 30 days for an appointment at a VA medical center, or if they live more than 40 miles from the nearest VA hospital.\n\nTrump stuck to the idea of allowing veterans to choose between public and private hospitals when he released his most recent \u201cTen Point Plan To Reform The VA\u201d in July.\n\nPoint 10 of the plan says: \u201cMr. Trump will ensure every veteran has the choice to seek care at the VA or at a private service provider of their own choice. Under a Trump Administration, no veteran will die waiting for service.\u201d\n\nTrump reinforced that part of his plan during the NBC News forum as well.\n\nTo be clear, Trump supports giving veterans a choice between VA hospitals and private ones. That\u2019s not the same thing as supporting the complete privatization of the system that provides care to veterans.\n\nTrump criticized Clinton for making \u201ca terrible mistake on Libya\u201d when she was secretary of State. But, at the time, Trump also supported U.S. action that led to the removal of Moammar Gadhafi from power.\n\nTrump made his claim in response to a question posed by Lauer on whether Trump will be \u201cprepared on Day One,\u201d if elected president, to tackle \u201ccomplex national security issues.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Trump has ignored his past support for the U.S. intervention in Libya.\n\nDuring the 10th GOP debate, Trump said he had \u201cnever discussed that subject\u201d when Sen. Ted Cruz called him out on supporting U.S. action in the country. But, as we wrote, Trump said in 2011 that the U.S. should go into Libya \u201con a humanitarian basis\u201d and \u201cknock [Gadhafi] out very quickly, very surgically, very effectively and save the lives.\u201d\n\nTrump made that comment in a video posted to his YouTube channel in February 2011:\n\nEven though Trump now says Clinton\u2019s support for intervention in Libya was a \u201cterrible mistake,\u201d it doesn\u2019t change the fact that five years ago he supported Gadhafi\u2019s removal.\n\nTrump twisted Clinton\u2019s words when he claimed Clinton said \u201cvets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\u201d Clinton said the problems in the Department of Veterans Affairs were not as \u201cwidespread\u201d as some Republican supporters of privatization of the VA claim, but she went on to acknowledge problems in the VA system \u2014 including the issue of wait times for doctors \u2014 and what she would do to address them.\n\nTrump highlighted the issue of wait times to see a doctor as \u201cone of the big problems\u201d in the VA, and then suggested Clinton doesn\u2019t think the VA has problems.\n\nLauer interrupted, noting that Clinton \u201cwent on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA.\u201d\n\nTrump insisted his version was accurate, adding, \u201cI\u2019m telling you \u2026 she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s not accurate. The comments in question from Clinton came during an interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow on Oct. 23, 2015. Maddow asked about talk among some Republicans of abolishing the VA and privatizing it. \u201cThe reason they are able to propose something that radical is because the problems at the VA seem so intractable,\u201d Maddow said.\n\nMaddow asked if Clinton had any \u201cnew ideas for trying to fix\u201d the VA. Here was Clinton\u2019s response, with the part Trump is referring to in bold.\n\nClinton accused Republicans of underfunding the VA because they \u201cwant it to fail\u201d so they can privatize it.\n\nClinton added, \u201cBut we have to be more creative about trying to fix the problems that are the legitimate concern, so that we can try to stymie the Republican assault.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the Clinton campaign website states that Clinton wants to \u201cfundamentally reform veterans\u2019 health care to ensure access to timely and high quality care.\u201d The campaign says Clinton \u201cwas outraged by the recent scandals at the VA, and as president, she will demand accountability and performance from VA leadership.\u201d The site specifically mentions Clinton\u2019s dissatisfaction that \u201c[m]any veterans have to wait an unacceptably long time to see a doctor or to process disability claims and appeals\u201d and promises she will \u201c[b]uild a 21st-century Department of Veterans Affairs to deliver world-class care.\u201d\n\nTrump cherry-picked the part of Clinton\u2019s response that said problems in the VA have \u201cnot been as widespread as it has been made out to be,\u201d to make the blanket claim that Clinton is \u201csatisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration\u201d and that \u201cvets are being treated, essentially, just fine.\u201d But Trump is leaving out the parts of Clinton\u2019s answer that acknowledged problems in the VA \u2014 including the wait time issue Trump highlighted as one of his biggest concerns.", "9": "Iranian negotiators reportedly have made a last-ditch push for more concessions from the U.S. and five other world powers as talks on the fate of Iran's nuclear program come down to the final days before a crucial deadline.\n\nThe New York Times reported late Sunday that Tehran had backed away from a tentative promise to ship a large portion of its uranium stockpile to Russia, where it could not be used as part of any future weapons program. Western officials insisted to the paper that the uranium did not have to be sent overseas, but could be disposed of in other ways.\n\nThe new twist in the talks comes just two days before the deadline for both sides to agree on a framework for a permanent deal. The final deadline for a permanent deal would not arrive until the end of June.\n\nHowever, if Iran insists on keeping its uranium in the country, it would undermine a key argument made in favor of the deal by the Obama administration. The Times reports that if the uranium had gone to Russia, it would have been converted into fuel rods, which are difficult to use in nuclear weapons. It is not clear what would happen to the uranium if it remained in Iran.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Sunday that Iran's position had shifted from from demanding that it be allowed to keep nearly 10,000 centrifuges enriching uranium, to agreeing to keep 6,000. Western officials involved in the talks told the Associated Press that Tehran may be ready to accept an even lower number.\n\nThe United States and its allies want a deal that extends the time Iran would need to make a nuclear weapon from the present two months to three months to at least a year. However, The Times reported Sunday that a paper published by Olli Heinonen, former head of inspections for the U.N.'s nuclear watchdog, estimated that Iran could still develop a nuclear weapon in seven or eight months with around 6,500 centrifuges.\n\nTehran says it wants to enrich uranium only for energy, science, industry and medicine. But many countries fear Iran could use the technology to make weapons-grade uranium.\n\nOfficials told the Associated Press that another main dispute involved the length of an agreement. Iran, they said, wants a total lifting of all caps on its activities after 10 years, while the U.S. and the five other nations at the talks \u2014 Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany \u2014 insist on progressive removal after a decade.\n\nA senior U.S. official characterized the issue as lack of agreement on what happens in years 11 to 15. The official spoke on condition of anonymity in line with State Department rules on briefing about the closed-door talks.\n\nLimits on Iran's research and development of centrifuges also were unresolved, the Western officials said.\n\nTehran has created a prototype centrifuge that it says enriches uranium 16 times faster than its present mainstay model. The U.S. and its partners want to constrain research that would increase greatly the speed of making enough weapons-grade uranium for a bomb, once limits on Iran's programs are lifted.\n\nOne official said Russia opposed the U.S. position that any U.N. penalties lifted in the course of a deal should be reimposed quickly if Tehran reneged on any commitments.\n\nBoth Western officials said Iran was resisting attempts to make inspections and other ways of verification as intrusive as possible.\n\nThere was tentative agreement on turning a nearly-finished reactor into a model that gives off less plutonium waste than originally envisaged. Plutonium, like enriched uranium, is a path to nuclear weapons.\n\nIran and the U.S. were discussing letting Iran run centrifuges at an underground bunker that has been used to enrich uranium. The machines would produce isotopes for peaceful applications, the officials said.\n\nWith the Tuesday deadline approaching and problems remaining, U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry canceled plans Sunday to return to the United States for an event honoring the late U.S. Sen. Edward Kennedy. French Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius and Frank-Walter Steinmeier, his German counterpart, scratched planned trips to Kazakhstan.\n\nKerry has been in discussions with Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif since Thursday.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nClick for more from The New York Times.", "10": "CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa \u2014 \u201cI had one of the most wonderful rallies of my entire career right here in 1992,\u201d Bill Clinton said by way of opening to the crowd of more than 1,100 on Saturday night.\n\nTwo days before the Iowa caucuses, Cedar Rapids tried to deliver that same old feeling to his wife, Hillary Clinton.\n\nIn the crowd,\u00a0one woman held a sign that said \u201c227 years of men. It\u2019s HER turn!\" Some carried signs and books. Others had traveled from as far as Missouri. They had waited hours, even after the fire marshal told them there was no more room inside the high school gymnasium.\n\nThe restive crowd chanted slogans and buzzed with anticipation until finally Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton all appeared on stage hand-in-hand, an hour behind schedule. As they roared, Hillary Clinton beamed.\n\nIt has been a long slog in Iowa for the Clinton campaign, which has struggled mightily to shake the label that its supporters can\u2019t muster the enthusiasm of its rival\u2019s backers. As the caucuses near, and with the help of a former president, the energy level\u00a0at her events are notably dialing up.\n\n\"He's a charismatic speaker,\" said Cigi Ross, 31. \"In general, I'd say he's a bigger draw for people.\"\n\nMonday night will put the campaign's months of their work to the test. Can the campaign\u2019s organization bring out their supporters? Can the candidate energize voters?\n\nClinton, who seemed to draw on the higher-than-usual energy, stood at the center of it all and delivered a confident closing statement.\n\n\u201cWhat we need is a plan, and a commitment,\u201d Clinton said at the top of her voice.\n\n\u201cAnd me, yes, thank you,\u201d Clinton finished.\n\nEight years later, Clinton is in Iowa once again facing what could be a nail-biting conclusion of a hard-fought campaign. Clinton acknowledges that it isn\u2019t just her campaign that has changed since her devastating loss here in her last run, she too has changed \u2014 and improved, she told CNN on Saturday.\n\n\"I think I am a different, and perhaps a better, candidate, so I hope that also shows,\" Clinton said in an interview with the network that morning.\n\nDays ago, Iowa seemed to be slipping from her grasp, but campaign aides are feeling more confident now. A slew of positive news, endorsements, and the latest poll from the Des Moines Register and Bloomberg News indicate the bleeding has at least slowed. That poll -- considered the gold standard in Iowa -- gave Clinton a slim lead over her rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.\n\nIf Democrats are wary of political dynasties, they didn\u2019t show it. Spotting someone in the audience carrying Chelsea Clinton's book, her father remarked: \"Thank you, young woman, for holding up her book.\"\n\nBill Clinton, who has spent days crisscrossing the state on his wife's behalf, has settled easily into this role as booster-in-chief. He lays off the policy, leaving that to his wife. He focuses instead on what he knows \"about the job.\"\n\n\u201cThere are certain, almost intangible qualities that determine whether a president succeeds or not,\u201d Clinton said, his voice raspy, even and low. \"You need a sticker. A sticker: someone who won\u2019t quit on you.\u201d\n\n\"She\u2019s the best at that I\u2019ve ever known,\u201d he added.", "11": "Donald Trump\u2019s organizational problems have gone from bad to worse to flat-out embarrassing. Here\u2019s Politico with the play-by-play from this weekend\u2019s Colorado GOP convention, the latest scene of Trump\u2019s delegate-securing failure:\n\nUnlike in most other states, Republicans in Colorado scrapped plans for a more traditional primary or caucus to award its delegates to this summer\u2019s national convention in Cleveland. Instead, the state GOP selected three delegates from each of the state\u2019s seven congressional districts at individual contests in the days leading up to the state convention, and then the remaining 13 delegates at the statewide event this past weekend. It was a rather convoluted process that favored campaigns that understood the rules and that had the ground game necessary to take advantage of them\u2014or, put another way, not the Trump campaign.\n\nAt the first two district-level contests, the billionaire\u2019s team showed up without an approved list of delegates to pass out to attendees, leaving supporters unsure of whom to back. And then at last Thursday\u2019s contest, two of the three delegates on the Trump campaign\u2019s list weren\u2019t actually on the official ballot since they failed to pay the necessary registration fees.\n\nThis past weekend\u2019s mix-up, though, was an even bigger embarrassment since at least one of the seven misnumbered names on the Trump-sanctioned list lined up with a Cruz-supporting delegate, according to NBC News. (Even without that mix-up, though, Cruz would have likely swept the contest anyway given his well-oiled delegate-selecting machine.) The Trump camp, though, appeared to blame the state GOP for the mistake, pointing to discrepancies between the delegate guides posted on the party's website and the printed materials distributed at the event. \u201cWe'll do whatever it takes to protect the legitimacy of our support in Colorado,\u201d Trump aide Alan Cobb told NBC, suggesting the campaign may challenge the results. \u201cClearly there are some serious issues with the ballot and balloting.\u201d\n\nTrump remains the favorite to arrive at the convention with the most delegates to his name, but he\u2019s far from assured of the majority of delegates he\u2019d need to win the nomination on the first ballot. Given that reality, the GOP front-runner recently retooled his campaign to address his clear weaknesses in the under-the-radar battle to send loyal delegates to the convention. If those efforts don't start paying dividends soon, though, Trump very well may arrive in Cleveland with the most delegates\u2014and leave without the nomination.", "12": "Click Here To Learn More About Alexandra's Personalized Essences Psychic Protection Click Here for More Information on Psychic Protection!

Senator Ernst is Iowa\u2019s first woman ever elected to either house of Congress and the first female military veteran to serve in the Senate.\n\nThe gender dimension does not go unnoticed. Please welcome \u201cour beautiful senators,\u201d says the veteran who introduces them. Ayotte mentions Ernst\u2019s military service \u2013 she\u2019s also a war veteran. But in most ways, the woman thing doesn\u2019t matter. This is just like any other political town hall in campaign season \u2013 one senator trying to help another who\u2019s locked in a tight reelection race.\n\nYet the stakes are high. Republican control of the US Senate could hinge on Ayotte\u2019s ability to fend off her Democratic challenger, Gov. Maggie Hassan. And across the country, women figure prominently in the Democrats\u2019 strategy to retake the Senate, nominating women in six of the 11 competitive races.\n\nThen there\u2019s Hillary Clinton, the first woman to win a major party\u2019s presidential nomination in the United States.\n\nIt\u2019s enough to call 2016 Year of the Woman 2.0, following the original, 1992, when female representation in the Senate jumped from two to six. Today, female senators number 20 out of 100, with potential to reach 24, depending on how the political winds are blowing by Election Day.\n\nGender diversity among major world powers is also rising, with the ascension of Theresa May to the British prime ministership. If Mrs. Clinton wins in November, three of the world\u2019s top five economies will be headed by women. (German Chancellor Angela Merkel is the other.)\n\nBut the numbers and the \u201cfirsts\u201d invite a deeper question: Do women really lead differently? From the halls of government to corporate boardrooms, it\u2019s a burning question.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re good listeners, and I think that helps,\u201d says Ayotte in an interview. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say my male colleagues aren\u2019t, because plenty of them are. But I think that we listen, and so we\u2019re picking up on where we see the common ground with other people.\u201d\n\nOn that point, there is bipartisan agreement.\n\n\u201cThere is good research that shows women tend to have different leadership styles,\u201d Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, New Hampshire\u2019s other senator, says in an interview. \u201cWe tend to be more inclusive, we\u2019re less autocratic in our decisionmaking. We like consensus, we like to get people around the table, and so I think that has made a difference.\u201d\n\nOf course, there\u2019s also the example of Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D) of California, the first woman speaker of the House (2007-11). During her tenure, she was known for her ability to wield power \u2013 and in a highly partisan way. More than with previous speakers, major legislation came out of her office, not the committees. She was (and is) a master fundraiser for Democrats writ large, a skill she has used to great effect in keeping her members in line.\n\nAnd as a Roman Catholic woman, Congresswoman Pelosi demonstrated at a crucial moment the power of networking. In 2010, when House passage of the Affordable Care Act appeared in doubt over the abortion issue, she tapped connections her male colleagues had never heard of \u2013 two associations of nuns, whose support for the bill proved pivotal.\n\nThe research on women\u2019s leadership style has been extensive \u2013 and mixed. One academic study, released in 2013, found that women are more attracted to cooperation than men. The reason is that men tend to have greater confidence in their abilities, while women tend to be more optimistic about their prospective teammates\u2019 abilities, according to the study by Peter Kuhn and Marie-Claire Villeval.\n\nNew research, released in August, looked specifically at gender differences in the US House of Representatives and found \u201clittle evidence to suggest women are inherently more cooperative or bipartisan.\u201d The only difference came with Republican women, who tend to recruit more cosponsors on legislation, including more from the opposite party. That tendency was most pronounced on so-called women\u2019s issues, such as education and social welfare.\n\n\u201cWe interpret these results as evidence that cooperation is mostly driven by a commonality of interest, rather than gender per se,\u201d write the authors, Stefano Gagliarducci and M. Daniele Paserman.\n\nThe study examined 20 years of data ending in 2008. Since then, female representation in Congress has ticked up a notch, reaching 20 percent in the Senate and nearly that in the House \u2013 the rough threshold for a perceived \u201ccritical mass\u201d of representation in which women can show perceptible influence.\n\nIndeed, since 2013, female legislators point to multiple examples of how the women of the Senate, in particular, have been instrumental in breaking through congressional gridlock. The best-known example is the end of the 2013 government shutdown, when women senators from both parties met privately over dinner and fashioned a compromise that would form the nucleus of the final deal.\n\nMore recently, the women of the Senate \u2013 all 20 of them, dubbed \u201cthe sisterhood\u201d \u2013 backed landmark legislation aimed at combating sex trafficking, which President Obama signed into law in May 2015.\n\nWhen asked for other examples, Senator Shaheen cites the 2013 reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. \u201cIt was considered dead,\u201d she says, \u201cand because all the women [senators] got on board and pushed it, we were able to get it through.\u201d\n\nShaheen also notes the growing number of women who serve in top spots on committees, such as the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, with Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R) of Alaska as chair and Sen. Maria Cantwell (D) of Washington as the ranking member. \u201cIt looks like we may get an energy bill done this year, and I think that speaks to their ability to work together, and to be flexible, and move our colleagues in the House,\u201d Shaheen says.\n\nBehind all this female power are the women senators\u2019 regular dinners, a chance to kick back and talk about whatever \u2013 their lives, their work, their male colleagues.\n\n\u201cWe go by Mikulski\u2019s rules \u2013 that what happens in those dinners stays in those dinners,\u201d says Shaheen, referring to Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D) of Maryland, the longest-serving woman in congressional history, who is about to retire. \u201cBut yeah, they\u2019ve proved to be a great opportunity to build relationships.\u201d\n\nAs it happens, Shaheen had hosted 12 of her female colleagues the night before at her office. On the menu: lobsters and clam chowder. That much she will reveal. Sen. Susan Collins (R) of Maine was there, Shaheen says, \u201cand we had a back and forth about whether the lobsters came from Maine or New Hampshire.\u201d\n\nIn 2013, after the Senate\u2019s 20 women helped end the government shutdown, Sen. John McCain (R) of Arizona wondered out loud: \u201cImagine what they could do if there were 50 of them.\u201d\n\nThat may sound logical, but the reality isn\u2019t so simple. While women do bring a distinctive perspective to policy, based on their life experiences, that doesn\u2019t necessarily make them less partisan, experts say. Some of the most polarizing issues are so-called women\u2019s issues, including health care, abortion, and equal pay.\n\n\u201cAs long as women\u2019s issues constitute a prominent division between the parties, there will be little bipartisan collaboration among women on these policies,\u201d Michele Swers, a political scientist at Georgetown University, wrote in The Washington Post in 2014.\n\nMs. Swers also notes that partisan sorting has made the South \u2013 a region less hospitable to women candidates \u2013 the stronghold of the Republican Party, while the more moderate brand of Republicanism that predominates in parts of the country more willing to elect women has declined.\n\nAnd because women tend to occupy the \u201cleftward wing\u201d of their respective parties, Democratic women in particular are less inclined to compromise, the Gagliarducci-Paserman study found.\n\nStill, none of this means women shouldn\u2019t be more rigorously recruited for public office, say leaders of both parties.\n\n\u201cWhat you need is more good people, and the process of excluding women has excluded good people from service,\u201d says former Gov. John Sununu (R) of New Hampshire. \u201cSo what you need to do is level the playing field.\u201d\n\nIn the business world, boosting female representation on corporate boards \u2013 now near 20 percent \u2013 has been a long-held goal. Advocates cite benefits to the bottom line. In a famous study, Catalyst Inc., a nonprofit that promotes women leaders in the workplace, found that corporate boards with the highest female representation attained \u201csignificantly higher financial performance\u201d than those with the lowest representation.\n\nBut whether in the private sector or in government, women as top executives are even rarer than women legislators. Only six of the nation\u2019s 50 governors are women, three Republicans and three Democrats. Among world leaders, fewer than two dozen are female. Among Fortune 500 companies, only 21 chief executive officers \u2013 or 4.2 percent \u2013 are women.\n\nWhile legislating is an inherently collaborative process, and therefore seems to play to women\u2019s strength, executive roles hew more toward public expectations of how men should behave, i.e., authoritatively.\n\n\u201cI think the more people see women in executive positions, the more they will see that as a normal course of business, and it\u2019s taken longer for that not just in politics but in the boardroom,\u201d says Shaheen.\n\nBut that becomes a Catch-22: Women don\u2019t step up because they don\u2019t see other women in those positions. \u201cSome would call it a confidence gap,\u201d says Liz Shuler, the No. 2 leader at the AFL-CIO. \u201cWe need to do more to increase the leadership skills-building opportunities, so that it becomes second nature for women to step up.\u201d (See interview with Ms. Shuler here.)\n\nBut do women executives really lead differently from men? Clinton echoes other women leaders on this point: \u201cI just think women in general are better listeners, are more collegial, more open to new ideas and how to make things work in a way that looks for a win-win outcome,\u201d she told Time magazine in January.\n\nMeta-analyses have found that women leaders, on average, are \u201cmore likely to be democratic, collaborative, and participative\u201d than their male counterparts, who are more likely to be \u201cautocratic and directive\u201d in their approach, writes Alice H. Eagly at TheConversation.com.\n\nOf course, there are exceptions. Margaret Thatcher of Britain and Golda Meir of Israel were both known for being tough and assertive. Today, Apple CEO Tim Cook is known for his team-oriented style. But for women aspiring to leadership posts, the challenge is to overcome societal expectations for how women are \u201csupposed to\u201d act \u2013 i.e., nice and nonconfrontational \u2013 while still projecting authority. Clinton has faced this \u201cdouble bind\u201d in both of her presidential campaigns.\n\nNew Hampshire has a strong record of female leadership. The governor, both US senators, and one of the state\u2019s two House members are women. The chief justice of the state Supreme Court is a woman. The chair of the state GOP is a woman.\n\nIn 2008, Granite Staters made history by electing the nation\u2019s first majority-female state legislative body, in the state Senate. In 2013, the state made history again by sending an all-female congressional delegation to Washington. That could happen again in January.\n\nWhat is it about New Hampshire that breeds women leaders? Start with a culture of independent-mindedness, and an enormous \u201ccitizens legislature\u201d \u2013 400 in the House, 24 in the Senate \u2013 in a state with only 1.3 million people. Members are paid just $100 a year, plus mileage. Sooner or later, the joke goes, everybody ends up serving.\n\n\u201cWe have so much local self-governance, women have the opportunity to try things out, to see how they like public service, and then they discover that they like it and that they\u2019re good at it, and one thing leads to the next,\u201d says Governor Hassan in an interview in the State House.\n\nHassan got her start advocating for her disabled son, which caught the notice of then-Governor Shaheen, who appointed her to a state educational funding commission. That led to regular interactions with state legislators \u2013 and an introduction to her next mentor, state Sen. Sylvia Larsen, who encouraged Hassan to run for state Senate. She spent six years there, eventually rising to majority leader, losing reelection, then staging a comeback by winning the governorship.\n\nThe common denominator for most women in politics, it seems, is mentors. Ask Ayotte, New Hampshire\u2019s junior senator, about Ruth Griffin, and her eyes light up. \u201cI love Ruth Griffin. She\u2019s my mentor!\u201d Ayotte gushes, referring to the nonagenarian grand dame of the New Hampshire Republican Party. (See interview with Mrs. Griffin here.)\n\nWhen Griffin served on the state Executive Council \u2013 an elected board that serves as a check on the governor \u2013 she advocated strongly for Ayotte, insisting the Democratic governor reappoint the Republican Ayotte as attorney general.\n\nShaheen, now a mentor to others, cites as her inspiration Marilla Ricker, the first woman to run for governor of New Hampshire \u2013 before women even had the right to vote. Shaheen also speaks fondly of the late Susan McLane, a Republican state senator \u201cwho was always very good to me.\u201d (Ms. McLane\u2019s daughter is Rep. Ann McLane Kuster (D) of New Hampshire.) Shaheen broke two gender barriers in N.H., first with her election as governor (1996), then as a US senator (2008).\n\nMen, too, have championed women politicians here. At a recent Republican women\u2019s chili fest in Stratham, N.H., Mr. Sununu recalls fighting to make Vesta Roy the first woman state Senate president, in 1983. \u201cThere\u2019s that classic picture of me standing at the state Senate door, cracked open, peeking in to make sure the 13 votes I had lined up for her stayed with her,\u201d Sununu says.\n\nWhether New Hampshire\u2019s success at electing women to higher office can be duplicated elsewhere remains an open question. Only two other states have two female US senators, and five others have female governors. New Hampshire is no longer the champ at electing women state legislators; that crown belongs to Colorado, with 42 percent. The top 10 states for female representation in state legislatures are mostly Northern, and the bottom 10 mostly Southern, suggesting cultural factors.\n\nOverall, women hold a higher percentage of state legislative seats (24.6 percent) than seats in Congress (19.4 percent, House and Senate combined). At least the female \u201cfarm team\u201d has more players than the \u201cmajor league,\u201d though those numbers still fall far short of matching the overall female population of the country, 50.8 percent.\n\nFor many women, reaching parity with men in government \u2013 and in business, the judiciary, the labor movement, and other spheres of life \u2013 is a deeply held goal. But a quick glance at the graphs charting female representation in state and national legislatures reveals a stark truth: Growth has nearly hit a plateau.\n\nIf progress continues at the current rate of change since 1960, women will not achieve equal representation in Congress until 2117, according to the Institute for Women\u2019s Policy Research. Women\u2019s representation in state legislatures, which more than quintupled between 1971 and 2015, has also essentially plateaued. What\u2019s going on?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not that women are running in droves and losing,\u201d says Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, N.J. \u201cWe know that when women run, they win at about the same rate as men do.\u201d\n\nWomen also do just as well in fundraising as men, even if they have to work harder to raise the same amount. Part of the problem, Ms. Walsh says, comes in the recruitment process. Much of the recruiting is done by white men, and they recruit who they know \u2013 other white men.\n\nThat is particularly so among Republicans: Only 17 percent of Republican state lawmakers are women, a rate that hasn\u2019t changed since the early 1990s. In contrast, Democrats doubled their rate of female state representation during the same period from 15 percent to 30 percent.\n\nIn Congress (both houses), the disparity is even more stark: Only 9 percent of Republicans are female, versus 33 percent of Democrats. In the Senate alone, only six of the 20 women members are Republican.\n\nWalsh cites several factors behind this gap: Republican women are perceived to be more moderate than their male counterparts, and can have a harder time making it out of the primaries, where turnout is low and skews conservative. The GOP also has no counterpart to Emily\u2019s List \u2013 a well-funded political action committee that helps pro-abortion-rights Democratic women get elected. And then there\u2019s the simple fact that more women identify as Democrats, so their recruitment pool is bigger.\n\nIn New Hampshire, where both legislative chambers are controlled by the Republicans, Democratic women legislators still outnumber Republican women legislators, 73 to 49. State GOP chair Jennifer Horn says the party \u2013 nationally, not just in New Hampshire \u2013 needs a message that\u2019s more inclusive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m being diplomatic \u2013 I think there are times when some of the folks in our party are not as sensitive to the fact that men and women see the world differently,\u201d says Ms. Horn. \u201cWhen we\u2019re talking about jobs and the economy, for example, we need to be cognizant of the fact that women are an economic engine in and of themselves.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the fact that, in both parties, women are less likely than men to run for office without being recruited.\n\nIn the Monitor\u2019s conversations with Ernst and Ayotte, both mentioned how they were asked several times to run for the Senate before saying yes \u2013 and both brought up family issues. Without using the word \u201cmultitasking,\u201d they both show that they have mastered that classic skill of the working mom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s about getting the message out about empowering women and saying, you can do this,\u201d says Ernst. \u201cIt is important that you have a supportive family, even more so for women. I have a teenage daughter right now \u2013 we\u2019re looking at colleges \u2013 and sometimes it\u2019s hard for a woman to be away. But there are ways of making it work.\u201d\n\nBefore running for Senate, Ayotte had been asked a couple of times to run for Congress, but declined \u2013 in part, she says, because she was pregnant, but also because she had plans in her work as a prosecutor.\n\nAyotte then excuses herself. \u201cI\u2019ve got to pick up my daughter before 5:30 or I\u2019m in trouble!\u201d", "16": "Shocking!

", "18": "Washington (CNN) For months, the White House and Congress have wrangled over a bill that would give lawmakers a greater say in the Iran nuclear deal the administration is hammering out along with other world powers.\n\nAnd now, less than two weeks after a framework agreement with Tehran was reached, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee is planning to take up the measure.\n\nOn Tuesday, the committee will consider amendments to Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker's Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act before deciding whether to have the full Senate vote on it.\n\nFor many in Congress, it's a very simple premise: Congress should weigh in on the terms of a final nuclear deal with Iran.\n\nBut for the White House, and some Democrats in Congress, that's an explosive idea that could derail the talks \u2014 and therefore must be stopped.\n\nSo what's in the bill?\n\nSupporters of the legislation have emphasized that it would allow Congress to give a thumbs up or down on the deal President Barack Obama is aiming to finalize with Iran by the negotiations' June 30 deadline. Backers think that's only fair since the United States is contemplating a major nuclear pact with a decadeslong enemy.\n\nThe bill would give Congress a chance to hold hearings, host briefings and pave the way to a vote on a joint resolution that could express approval or disapproval of the deal. It also requires the Obama administration to quickly report to Congress on details of the deal and regularly assess whether Iran is keeping its commitments. And it spells out what the President needs to do vis-a-vis Congress if Iran is found violating the terms.\n\nBut most important, it would keep Obama from waiving any congressional sanctions on Iran during Congress' 60-day review period. And if Congress passes a joint resolution of disapproval, then sanctions could not be lifted even after that time.\n\nDoes this hurt the diplomatic effort to reach a final deal?\n\nIran's primary reason for agreeing to the deal's limits on its nuclear program is to get sanctions relief.\n\nIranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani have insisted sanctions must be lifted on Day One of the deal. While the Obama administration has said it would wait several months before lifting sanctions -- to verify that Iran has taken major steps to roll back its program \u2014 the President is counting on having some latitude to waive sanctions in order to give Iran an incentive to sign the deal and then keep its commitments.\n\nThe Corker bill makes it less likely sanctions would be lifted, and lifted in a timely way, which gives less encouragement to Iran.\n\nWithout the bill, could Obama lift all sanctions on Iran?\n\nNot all, but most \u2014 at least for a limited time.\n\nWithout the Corker-Menendez bill (named after Corker and lead Democratic co-sponsor Sen. Bob Menendez), Iran could see nearly all nuclear-related sanctions at least temporarily lifted. Those enacted through the United Nations and by presidential executive order could be fully removed, and most of those passed by Congress could be waived by Obama until he leaves office, when they would go back into effect unless the next president continues to waive them.\n\nIf the Corker-Menendez bill becomes law and a deal is finalized, Obama wouldn't be able to lift the congressional sanctions for at least 60 days.\n\nDuring that 60-day review phase, the bill says Obama can't \"waive, suspend, reduce, provide relief from, or otherwise limit the application of statutory sanctions.\"\n\nHow can Obama waive sanctions passed by Congress anyway?\n\nThe biggest sanctions package approved by Congress, widely credited with crippling Iran's economy and bringing the country to the negotiating table, was the 2010 Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act.\n\nIt included a provision that gives the President leverage to waive sanctions for a limited time if he determines it's in the U.S. national security interest.\n\nHe wouldn't be able to permanently sunset the sanctions, though, unless Iran cuts its ties with and stops funding terror organizations around the world, an aspect not being addressed in the current negotiations with Iran and not predicted to happen any time soon.\n\nThe administration says sanctions are where Congress could eventually weigh in on the Iran deal -- by repealing them -- but that would only happen if lawmakers deem the deal a good one.\n\nHow would Congress weigh in during the 60-day review period?\n\nCongress could pass a joint resolution approving of the deal or disapproving of the deal and forbidding any sanctions relief. Or it could do nothing, allowing Obama to implement the sanctions, and by implication the deal, after the 60 days are up.\n\nA joint resolution disapproving of the deal would need to muster a two-thirds majority, though, to override the veto Obama has promised -- an unlikely, but not entirely unthinkable, scenario.\n\nAre there other reasons that Obama opposes this bill?\n\nFirst, he's facing a combative, Republican majority in both houses of Congress. Those Republicans have sought to undermine his negotiations with Iran at every turn. Giving those lawmakers a legislative avenue to slam the terms of an eventual deal would, at best, be a political blow to Obama and his administration's efforts to broker an agreement.\n\nThere's also the White House's argument that the executive branch has the power to broker international agreements without Congress meddling, while congressional oversight of the Iran deal would set a dangerous precedent. Most international agreements aren't treaties ratified by Congress, and Obama has argued that U.S. allies need to know they can count on those agreements holding up.\n\nVirtually every Senate Republican supports the bill and nine Democrats have signed on as co-sponsors, including independent Sen. Angus King, who caucuses with Democrats. Several more on the left are leaning toward supporting the bill.\n\nThat means backers will likely pass the bill with a filibuster-proof majority. It's unclear, though, if they can muster enough Democrats willing to vote to override Obama's veto.\n\nIt's not just the numbers, though. Some powerful Democrats are supporting the legislation. Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the No. 3 Senate Democrat, who will become the chamber's Democratic leader when Minority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada retires at the end of his term, is a big proponent of the legislation.\n\nMenendez, of New Jersey, who has been working to rally Democrats around legislation on Iran throughout the negotiations, remains the most vocal Democrat on the issue. He was the top-ranked Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee until stepping aside to face corruption charges handed down earlier in the month.\n\nAlso, Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, one of the earliest Obama backers during the 2008 campaign, has been insistent on the need for Congress to weigh in and has worked behind the scenes to make Corker's bill more palatable to Democrats -- and the White House. But so far that effort hasn't succeeded, as the White House remains opposed.", "19": "While paging through Pew's best data visualizations of 2014 (it's awesome), I came across what I believe to be one of the best and most revealing charts about the state of American politics. Here it is:\n\nThe chart, which comes from Pew's amazing political polarization project, shows how partisans of both parties have grown both increasingly unified amongst themselves\u00a0and increasingly far apart from their partisan others over just the last 20 years. As recently as 1994, seven in 10 Democrats were more consistently liberal than the median Republican. \u00a0As of 2014, it's a whopping 94 percent. Same goes for Republicans; 64 percent of GOPers were more consistently conservative than the median Democrat in 1994 while 92 percent are today. In addition, \"the overall share of Americans who express consistently conservative or consistently liberal opinions has doubled over the past two decades from 10 percent to 21 percent,\" according to Pew.\n\nTo me, this chart is so important -- particularly in a week where a new Congress arrives in Washington -- because it reveals that the polarization of our elected officials isn't some sort of \"only in Washington\" thing. \u00a0The increasing partisanship of Congress is a direct reflection of the increasing partisanship of the country. After all, that's who elects these people to Congress, right?\n\nSo, when you hear people decry the partisanship of their elected officials in Washington, don't believe it. \u00a0We have the Congress we want -- even if we aren't totally honest with ourselves all the time about what that is. \u00a0And, we get the results -- not many -- from our elected officials that you have to expect when you have a country as polarized as ours.", "20": "With little fanfare this fall, the New York developer who had planned to build an Islamic community center north of the World Trade Center announced that he would instead use the site for a 70-story tower of luxury condos.\n\nThose who had rallied in opposition to the building because of its religious affiliation back in 2010 were exultant. \u201cThe importance of the defeat of the Ground Zero Mosque cannot be overstated,\u201d Pamela Geller, president of the American Freedom Defense Initiative, wrote on the website Breitbart in September. \u201cThe Ground Zero Mosque became a watershed issue in our effort to raise awareness of and ultimately halt and roll back the advance of Islamic law and Islamic supremacism in America.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all well and good that so many Republicans have condemned Donald Trump\u2019s reprehensible call for \u201ca total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.\u201d House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (Wis.) was particularly forceful, calling proper attention to the \u201cmany Muslims serving in our armed forces, dying for this country.\u201d\n\nWhen he was president, George W. Bush honorably put a lid on right-wing Islamophobia. He regularly praised American Muslims and stressed that the United States needed Muslim allies to fight violent extremism. Once Bush was gone, restraint on his side of politics fell away.\n\nThus, Trump\u2019s embrace of a religious test for entry to our country did not come out of nowhere. On the contrary, it simply brought us to the bottom of a slippery slope created by the ongoing exploitation of anti-Muslim feeling for political purposes.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to reach far back in time to see why Trump figured he had the ideological space for his Muslim ban. Last month, it was Jeb Bush who introduced the idea of linking the rights of Syrian refugees to their religion. He said he was comfortable granting admission to \u201cpeople like orphans and people who are clearly not going to be terrorists. Or Christians.\u201d Asked how he\u2019d determine who was Christian, he explained that \u201cyou can prove you\u2019re a Christian.\u201d\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) took a similar view, saying , \u201cThere is no meaningful risk of Christians committing acts of terror.\u201d\n\nTrump took limits on Muslim access to our country to their logical \u2014 if un-American and odious \u2014 conclusion. Vice President Biden said that Trump was serving up \u201ca very, very dangerous brew,\u201d but the brew has been steeping for a long time. This is why the \u201cGround Zero Mosque\u201d episode is so instructive.\n\nThe demagoguery began with the labeling of the controversy itself. As PolitiFact pointed out, \u201cthe proposed mosque is not at or on Ground Zero. It does not directly abut it or overlook it.\u201d It was \u201ctwo long blocks\u201d away. And while a mosque was part of the proposed cultural center, the plans also included \u201ca swimming pool, gym and basketball court, a 500-seat auditorium, a restaurant and culinary school, a library and art studios.\u201d\n\nThis didn\u2019t stop opponents from going over the top, and Newt Gingrich deserved some kind of award for the most incendiary comment of all. \u201cNazis,\u201d he said, \u201cdon\u2019t have the right to put up a sign next to the Holocaust museum in Washington.\u201d\n\nWhen President Obama defended the right of developers to build the project, he was \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014 accused of being out of touch, and Republicans were happy to make the Muslim center and Obama\u2019s defense of religious rights an issue in the 2010 campaign.\n\n\u201cI think it does speak to the lack of connection between the administration and Washington and folks inside the Beltway and mainstream America,\u201d said Sen. John Cornyn (Tex.), who was then chairman of the committee in charge of electing Republicans to the Senate. Voters, he said, felt they were \u201cbeing lectured to, not listened to.\u201d Sound familiar?\n\nAt the time, John Feehery, the veteran Republican strategist, put his finger on why Republicans were so eager to lambaste Obama\u2019s response to the Ground Zero issue. \u201cThis will help drive turnout for the GOP base,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Republican establishment is now all upset with Trump, but he is simply the revenge of a Republican base that took its leaders\u2019 pandering \u2014 on Islam and a host of other issues \u2014 seriously.\n\nYou can\u2019t be \u201cjust a little\u201d intolerant of Muslims, any more than you can be \u201cjust a little\u201d prejudiced against Catholics or Jews. Once the door to bigotry is opened, it is very hard to shut.\n\nRead more from E.J.

Bush.\n\n\u201cI\u00a0have no time for people who are partisan for the sake of being partisan,\u201d Ms. Clinton, a Democrat and former secretary of state, told a crowd that welcomed her enthusiastically in a historic building at Snug Harbor Cultural Center.\n\nMs. Clinton was the second leading presidential candidate to speak on Staten Island today, after Republican Donald Trump delivered a typical stump speech at a Republican brunch. But Ms. Clinton, perhaps sensing or recalling Staten Island\u2019s ever-present desire for politicians to pay attention to the forgotten borough, delivered a speech that seemed to be especially tailored for the borough, which is more conservative than the rest of New York City. The majority of its voters are registered Democrats, but the borough routinely swings Republican.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u00a0ran in 2000, I\u00a0didn\u2019t carry Staten Island. When I\u00a0ran in 2006, I\u00a0did,\u201d Ms. Clinton said today. \u201cI\u2019ve got no problem\u00a0with people having political disagreements. That\u2019s in America\u2019s DNA,\u00a0isn\u2019t it?\u201d\n\nInstead, Ms. Clinton decried \u201cdeliberate efforts to set Americans against each other.\u201d She harkened back to representing the borough of cops and firefighters\u00a0on\u00a0September 11, 20001,\u00a0when nearly 300 Staten Islanders were killed in the terror attacks. She noted the city\u2019s mayor, the state\u2019s governor, and the president were all Republicans.\n\n\u201cI\u00a0did not for one minute stop and say to myself: \u2018Well, I\u00a0don\u2019t know, can we work together?'\u201d Ms. Clinton said. \u201cHow absurd is that?\u201d\n\nMs. Clinton said with 3,000 people murdered, people \u201cpulled together\u201d and \u201cpolitics was totally left behind.\u201d She had criticized President Bush for his handling of a strong economy he \u201cinherited\u201d from her husband, President Bill Clinton, and for other reasons. But she praised him for approving billions of dollars to rebuild lower Manhattan after the terror attacks, even as others in Washington didn\u2019t want to spend it.\n\n\u201cI publicly say, \u2018Thank you President George W.\u00a0Bush,\u2019 for making sure that we got the money that we needed to rebuild our city,\u201d Ms. Clinton said.\n\nShe also touted her record working for the borough after the attacks, including sounding the alarm on air quality and pushing for the passage of the Zadroga Act. Ms. Clinton went on to discuss her foreign policy experience, saying anyone who wants to president has to be able to offer specifics on what they would do\u2014an allusion to her Democratic rival Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2014but also has to be able to keep people safe.\n\n\u201cMaybe we take that more seriously here\u00a0in New York, but we should,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd we are going to do everything we can to keep America safe.\u201d\n\nShe\u00a0cited her work building a coalition that \u201cbrought Iran to the negotiating table,\u201d without mentioning how controversial that final Iran deal was for President Barack Obama.\n\nMs. Clinton\u2019s rally had little in common with Mr. Trump\u2019s Staten Island event, except one thing: the crowd at both seemed to hate Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. Ms. Clinton mentioned his plan to spy on\u00a0Muslim neighborhoods, which has also been dismissed by Police Commissioner Bill Bratton.\n\nAt the mention of Mr. Cruz\u2019s name, the crowd offered a chorus of boos.\n\nThe crowd had been hyped\u00a0up\u00a0for Ms. Clinton before she even arrived, and gave a nice response to several local pols as they urged people\u00a0to get out the vote on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHillary is the only one with the experience,\u201d said Councilwoman Debi Rose, a Democrat who represents the borough\u2019s North Shore.\u00a0\u201cShe knows what it\u2019s like to be in the White House. She knows the realities. She knows that living and running the White House in this country is not a reality show.\u201d\n\nMs. Clinton, at the end of her speech, offered the kind of promise Staten Island always loves\u2014and the kind it holds politicians to, if the way the Staten Island Advance\u00a0repeatedly agitated and inquired about a town hall\u00a0Mayor Bill de Blasio will finally hold here on Wednesday night is\u00a0any indication.\n\n\u201cI\u00a0want you to hold me accountable,\u201d Ms. Clinton said. \u201cI\u00a0will be coming back to Staten Island when I am your president.\u201d", "23": "Mitch McConnell has an unusual admonition for the new Republican majority as it takes over the Senate this week: Don\u2019t be \u201cscary.\u201d\n\nThe incoming Senate majority leader has set a political goal for the next two years of overseeing a functioning, reasonable majority on Capitol Hill that scores some measured conservative wins, particularly against environmental regulations, but probably not big victories such as a full repeal of the health-care law. McConnell\u2019s priority is to set the stage for a potential GOP presidential victory in 2016.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want the American people to think that if they add a Republican president to a Republican Congress, that\u2019s going to be a scary outcome. I want the American people to be comfortable with the fact that the Republican House and Senate is a responsible, right-of-center, governing majority,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said in a broad interview just before Christmas in his Capitol office.\n\nIt\u2019s a far cry from his defiant declaration in 2010 that his \u201csingle most important\u201d goal was to make President Obama a one-term president, an antagonizing oath that Democrats frequently invoke to embarrass the GOP leader \u2014 Obama won reelection comfortably in 2012, and McConnell\u2019s party lost seats.\n\nNow in charge at both ends of the Capitol, Republicans aim to avoid the worst excesses of the past four years and make sure the public isn\u2019t fearful of the GOP\u2019s course.\n\n\u201cThere would be nothing frightening about adding a Republican president to that governing majority,\u201d McConnell said, explaining how he wants voters to view the party on the eve of the 2016 election. \u201cI think that\u2019s the single best thing we can do, is to not mess up the playing field, if you will, for whoever the nominee ultimately is.\u201d\n\nBut McConnell, who will become majority leader Tuesday, is not planning to avoid conflict altogether. He wants to use the annual spending bills to compel Obama to accept conservative policy riders that will divide Democrats, similar to the December spending bill\u2019s inclusion of a provision benefiting Wall Street firms involved in risky derivative trades. That rider brought a liberal outcry but did not end up torpedoing the bill, which had Obama\u2019s support.\n\nMcConnell has been coaching his members to understand that, in the initial rounds, they will have to almost unanimously support the budget outline and the spending bills, because few Democrats will support their policy riders.\n\nWith 54 Republicans in his caucus, McConnell knows that he\u2019s a long way from getting 67 votes to override an Obama veto and that it won\u2019t even be easy getting six Democrats to regularly support legislation so that he can overcome likely filibusters led by the incoming minority leader, Sen. Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.). Still, on some issues, such as energy and taxes on the health industry, McConnell thinks there\u2019s enough bipartisan support to get bills onto Obama\u2019s desk.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019d like to be relevant. They\u2019d like to be part of the process,\u201d he said of discussions with some rank-and-file Democrats. \u201cAssuming we will have on most issues a largely unified conference \u2014 I don\u2019t expect that on everything \u2014 it wouldn\u2019t take a whole lot of Democrats to actually pass legislation in the Senate.\u201d\n\nBut McConnell said those who are \u201ccraving some grand deal as a way to measure the next two years\u201d should lower their expectations. He\u2019s very skeptical of such bargains with Democrats on tough issues such as immigration and entitlement reform. Instead, he believes three issues have potential common ground: international trade deals, an overhaul of the tax code and new revenue streams for infrastructure projects.\n\n\u201cCould the country use a lot more? You bet. But there\u2019s no way you can overcome a reluctant president on something really large,\u201d McConnell said. The best he can do on some of those bigger issues is force Obama to break out his veto pen so there is a clear set of Democratic policy stances Republicans can campaign against in 2016.\n\nDemocrats are dubious of McConnell\u2019s pledge to avert edge-of-the-cliff moments. They believe he will run into the same problems that have bedeviled House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) during the past four years \u2014 including the inability to corral rabble-rousers such as Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) to support an agenda that conservative critics will probably view as not bold enough in challenging Obama. Appeasing those far-right conservatives will lead to an agenda that Democrats hope to exploit in 2016.\n\n\u201cWhat Senator McConnell wants people to think and what they will think when they see the results for themselves are two very different things,\u201d said Reid\u2019s spokesman, Adam Jentleson. \u201cSenator McConnell heads a caucus that is obsessed with rigging the game against working people in favor of wealthy special interests. That\u2019s a scary fact indeed, and he won\u2019t be able to hide it.\u201d\n\nWhile McConnell\u2019s office is adorned with a portrait of Kentucky\u2019s only other Senate majority leader \u2014 Alben W. Barkley, whose tenure was often marked by clashes with his own party\u2019s president, Franklin D. Roosevelt \u2014 his model more resembles that of George Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader from 1989 through 1994.\n\nWithout ever shutting down the government, Mitchell stared down a president of the opposite party, George H.W. Bush, and won several liberal victories in a 1990 budget showdown. Mitchell also delivered a slew of legislation to Bush\u2019s desk that drew a veto, helping frame the debate for the 1992 election on domestic policy.\n\nMcConnell has recently studied other two-term presidents on how often they vetoed legislation in their last two years in office. Obama has issued only two minor vetoes over technical matters, largely because the previously Democratic-run Senate prevented anything from reaching his desk that he opposed.\n\nMcConnell suggested that a veto strategy would help clarify issues for voters. \u201cI think his bureaucracy across the board has done a lot of damage to the country. .\u2009.\u2009. I\u2019d at least like for him to have to personally take responsibility for it, even if he in the end decides to veto the bill over some restriction on EPA regulations.\u201d\n\nMcConnell is keenly aware of the challenges of reining in some of the impulses that his fellow Republican lawmakers have developed over eight straight years in the minority.\n\nThe first test will come on an energy debate, which could begin by the end of this week. McConnell is trying to keep his side from offering amendments not related to energy issues. In recent years, when some rank-and-file Republicans wanted to stop the Senate in its tracks, they would threaten amendments related to how Congress gets its health care.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve asked my members to restrain themselves,\u201d he said.\n\nRestraint has been hard to come by in this political era, particularly because a small army of conservative groups has made it a mission to push Republicans to the most strident stands, even if it means shutting down the government or risking default on the national debt.\n\nMcConnell faced some of those groups firsthand when they supported his 2014 primary challenger, and he faced a grinding general election against a Democrat who was well financed.\n\nIt cost nearly $30\u00a0million from his campaign war chest and tens of millions of dollars more from outside groups. Winning both races handily, McConnell is delivering a message to Republicans on how to behave heading into 2016.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t try to reinvent yourself. Be yourself, number one. And don\u2019t be afraid of a primary. We will win all the primaries. We did it in \u201914. We will do it in \u201916,\u201d McConnell said.\n\nShortly after Election Day this fall, McConnell sat down with Obama for a rare one-on-one meeting in the Oval Office, a huddle that both sides kept largely secret. In the pre-Christmas interview, McConnell acknowledged that the meeting\u2019s purpose was only to discuss areas where the president and Republicans might find bipartisan agreement \u2014 because their disagreements on other issues were too in\u00adtrac\u00adtable.\n\nThat meeting, he said, focused on trade deals, a tax code overhaul and infrastructure funding. \u201cCan we get there on tax reform, trade, infrastructure?\u201d he said.\n\nHe eschewed the idea of holding the debt ceiling hostage to gain spending-cut concessions from Obama, a tool Republicans had to use before because they were in the minority.\n\n\u201cWe are in the majority. We can pass a budget. We can determine how much we\u2019re going to spend,\u201d he said.\n\nAvoiding those moments could make for a less \u201cscary\u201d Congress, giving the Republicans a better chance in 2016 to hit the trifecta and gain the White House. His own horse is already chosen, Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), but don\u2019t expect McConnell to be out on the campaign trail or doing any other favors for his home-state colleague.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be supporting Rand Paul. But he knows that beyond that, I won\u2019t be involved in presidential politics. I\u2019ve got a big job here,\u201d he said.", "24": "Mises.org November 1, 2016 Inferno is a great thriller, featuring Tom Hanks reprising his role as Professor Robert Langdon. The previous movie adaptations of Dan Brown\u2019s books ( Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code ) were a success, and I expect Inferno will do well in theaters, too. Langdon is a professor of symbology whose puzzle solving skills and knowledge of history come in high demand when a billionaire leaves a trail of clues based on Dante\u2019s Inferno to a biological weapon that would halve the world\u2019s population. The villain, however, has good motives. As a radical Malthusian, he believes that the human race needs halving if it is to survive at all, even if through a plague. Malthus\u2019s name is not mentioned in the movie, but his ideas are certainly there. Inferno provides us an opportunity to unpack this overpopulation fear, and see where it stands today. Thomas Malthus (1766\u20131834) thought that the potential exponential growth of population was a problem. If the population increases faster than the means of subsistence, then, \u201cThe superior power of population cannot be checked without producing misery or vice.\u201d Is overpopulation a problem? The economics of population size tell a different, less scary, story. While it is certainly possible that some areas can become too crowded for some people\u2019s preferences, as long as people are free to buy and sell land for a mutually agreeable price, overcrowding will fix itself. As an introvert who enjoys nature and peace and quiet, I am certainly less willing to rent an apartment in the middle of a busy, crowded city. The prices I\u2019m willing to pay for country living versus city living reflect my preferences. And, to the extent that others share my preferences or even have the opposite preferences, the use and construction of homes and apartments will economize in both locations. Our demands and the profitability of the varied real estate offerings keep local populations in check. But what about on a global scale? The Inferno villain was concerned with world population. He stressed the urgency of the situation, but I don\u2019t see any reason to worry. Google tells me that we could fit the entire world population in Texas and everybody would have a small, 100 square meter plot to themselves. Indeed, there are vast stretches of land across the globe with little to no human inhabitants. Malthus and his ideological followers must have a biased perspective, only looking at the crowded streets of a big city. If it\u2019s not land that\u2019s a problem, what about the \u201cmeans of subsistence\u201d? Are we at risk of running out of food, medicine, or other resources because of our growing population? No. A larger population not only means more mouths to feed, but also more heads, hands, and feet to do the producing. Also, as populations increase, so does the variety of skills available to make production even more efficient. More people means everybody can specialize in a more specific and more productive comparative advantage and participate in a division of labor. Perhaps this question will drive the point home: Would you rather be stranded on an island with two other people or 20 other people? Malthus wouldn\u2019t be a Malthusian if he could see this data The empirical evidence is compelling, too. In the graph below, we can see the sort of world Malthus saw: one in which most people were barely surviving, especially compared to our current situation. Our 21st-century world tells a different story. Extreme poverty is on the decline even while world population is increasing. Hans Rosling, a Swedish medical doctor and \u201ccelebrity statistician,\u201d is famous for his \u201cDon\u2019t Panic\u201d message about population growth. He sees that as populations and economies grow, more have access to birth control and limit the size of their families. In this video , he shows that all countries are heading toward longer lifespans and greater standards of living. Finally, there\u2019s the hockey stick of human prosperity. Estimates of GDP per capita on a global, millennial scale reveal a recent dramatic turn. The inflection point coincides with the industrial revolution. Embracing the productivity of steam-powered capital goods and other technologies sparked a revolution in human well-being across the globe. Since then, new sources of energy have been harnessed and computers entered the scene. Now, computers across the world are connected through the internet and have been made small enough to fit in our pockets. Goods, services, and ideas zip across the globe, while human productivity increases beyond what anybody could have imagined just 50 years ago. \nI don\u2019t think Malthus himself would be a Malthusian if he could see the world today. \nNote: The views expressed on Mises.org are not necessarily those of the Mises Institute.

But two longtime GOP veterans says they wouldn't bet on the effort working.\n\nThe effort comes at a rough time for the GOP. As the Democratic Party's heaviest hitters, including President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, line up behind Hillary Clinton and against Trump, Republicans have been forced to criticize their own nominee. Recent comments from Trump about a federal judge's Mexican heritage have drawn widespread rebuke and put GOP leaders in a corner as they defend their endorsement of Trump while disavowing his comments.\n\nOne of the vocal advocates for a delegate revolt is conservative commentator and Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol, who has also been actively seeking a candidate to mount an independent bid against Trump, thus far to no avail.\n\nKristol tweeted late Thursday that the idea of a \"conscience convention,\" where delegates are free to vote for whomever they want to, is also appealing.\n\n\"I've been focused on independent candidacy, & still am. But struck by sudden level of interest in possible delegate revolt at convention,\" Kristol tweeted. He added: \"A Convention of Conscience in Cleveland would be quite something. Made easier by fact Trump only won minority of total primary votes anyway.\"\n\nBob Vander Plaats, the head of The Family Leader, an influential social conservative group in Iowa, told CNN's Kate Bolduan Friday morning that \"everything does need to be on the table\" at the convention, though he stopped short of calling for a revolt on the convention floor.\n\n\"We want a principled conservative and disciplined candidate who is the standard-bearer of this party,\" said Vander Plaats, who backed Texas Sen. Ted Cruz during the primaries. He said Trump has time before the convention to \"have the concerns laid to rest.\"\n\n\"All I'm doing is adapting to the circumstances,\" Kendal Unruh told ABC. \"I certainly believe Trump's demagogic racist comments are hurting him.\"\n\nThe rules enacted by the previous convention, which govern in 2016 until delegates pass a new set of rules, state that even if a delegate casts a ballot for a candidate other than one they are bound to, the convention secretary will record their bound vote.\n\nIn order to change that rule, the 112 delegates (two from each state and territory) on the Rules Committee would have to pass different rules and bring those to the floor of the convention, where a majority of delegates present would have to approve them.\n\nRules expert and RNC veteran Jim Bopp, an Indiana delegate who serves as special counsel to the RNC Rules Committee, said he has spoken with people who want to \"keep the option open to manipulate the rules in some way to deny Trump the nomination,\" but he said he wouldn't bet on any changes.\n\n\"I would put money on no rules changes that would affect the outcome of the nominating process,\" Bopp told CNN. \"I think it's highly likely that no rules changes would be adopted that would affect the nomination.\"\n\nBopp said there's also a counter movement within Rules insiders to pass a rule that would prevent any other rules changes from going into effect until the close of the convention.\n\nRules Committee and Oregon RNC member Solomon Yue is behind that effort, and has been pushing the RNC this year to adopt rules that give less power to the party and more to the delegates. He tried but failed to get the party to adopt rules that would require bigger majorities to pass business at the convention.\n\nYue says with roughly 80% of the convention delegates being either Trump or Cruz backers, the anti-Trump forces don't have much strength.\n\n\"The common denominator of the delegates is anti-establishment, anti-Washington,\" Yue said. \"And if you think about 'Never Trump' people, they are representing Washington and the establishment.\"\n\nPart of the philosophy for a delegate revolt comes from longtime RNC veteran Curly Haugland, from North Dakota, and a book he co-wrote with public policy consultant Sean Parnell. \"Unbound\" uses the history of the RNC to make the case that RNC rules dictate that delegates be allowed to vote their conscience.\n\n\"What Curly and I are contending is that because of RNC rules, there is no such thing as binding,\" Parnell told CNN, saying the binding rules that currently are in place are in a part of the rules package that govern pre-convention during the delegate selection process.\n\nBut Parnell also acknowledged that any effort to make the interpretation stick would require at the very least a handful of state delegations if not a majority of delegates on the floor.\n\n\"It would be messy. Good television though,\" Parnell said. \"I would not call it likely. My hope is that delegates are free to vote however they want to vote, and it's going to be up to the chair whether or not to allow that. But I think unless Donald Trump actually does go shoot somebody on Fifth Avenue, I don't think this is going to cost him the nomination.\"\n\nNeither the Trump campaign nor Republican National Committee immediately responded to a request for comment on the chatter about a delegate revolt.\n\nThere has been intense focus on the Rules Committee for months, going back to when there was a possibility of no Republican candidate getting enough delegates to clinch the nomination outright. With the prospect of a contested convention, the Cruz campaign made a concerted effort to stock the Rules Committee and state delegations with loyalists who would support Rules that would benefit Cruz in a bid to win the nomination on multiple ballots.\n\nBut after Cruz lost Indiana soundly and suspended his campaign, the prospect of a contested convention vanished and Trump rolled to the magic number to clinch the nomination.\n\nMeanwhile, the Cruz campaign urged supporters to continue to become delegates and earn leadership spots to influence the platform at the convention.\n\nThough some in the party have never warmed to Trump, the intensity of finding a way to prevent his formal nomination has grown in recent days after Trump's comments about a federal judge inflamed even the leaders of his own party.\n\nTrump questioned the impartiality of the district court judge overseeing a lawsuit related to his venture Trump University, saying the Indiana-born judge's Mexican ancestry could bias him against Trump. The mogul cited his campaign promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico in making the comments.\n\nThough the presumptive nominee has repeatedly stood behind and doubled down on the comments, his stance has drawn outrage from the likes of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called the remarks \"the textbook definition of a racist comment.\"\n\nStill, only a small handful of Republicans have withdrawn or withheld their endorsements of Trump. Vulnerable Illinois Sen. Mark Kirk disavowed Trump this week and said he could not endorse the party's nominee after all, but Ryan, McConnell and others have stood by their endorsements, saying Clinton would be a worse choice.", "26": "Meanwhile, Democrat Bernie Sanders picked up more delegates in the two states than Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe Vermont senator's still way behind, but says he's not giving up, calling his win in West Virginia \"tremendous.\"\n\nClinton still holds a commanding delegate lead, but Sanders still has the fight in him.\n\n\"We are in this campaign to win the Democratic nomination!\" he declared.\n\nBut Sanders' quest appears to be almost impossible, with Clinton 94 percent of the way to winning the nomination.\n\n\"I am, if I am so fortunate enough as to be the nominee - I am looking forward to debating Donald Trump come the fall,\" she said.\n\nStill, Clinton faces the FBI investigation of her email scandal.\n\nIn addition, her loss in West Virginia, a state she took in 2008, was payback for her statements in March that a lot of coal miners and coal companies would be out of business.\n\nShe's also polling badly among whites, men, and young people, with many loyal Sanders supporters vowing to never vote for her.\n\nMeanwhile, on the Republican side, Trump kept rolling, winning West Virginia and Nebraska.\n\nThe billionaire told the Associated Press\u00a0he's looking at five or six people as his running mate, all with deep political experience.\n\nOne person that Trump will likely not be considering is Sen. Marco Rubio, who told CNN he disagrees with Trump's \"America first\" foreign policy.\n\n\"I have well defined differences with the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party,\" Rubio said. \"And like millions of Republicans, you try to reconcile those two things.\"\n\nTrump will be meeting on Capitol Hill Thursday with Republican leaders, a group he has railed against, to try to patch up the public differences they've had.\n\nUnifying the Democrats is going to be an issue for Clinton too, as many Sanders voters have said they wouldn't vote for her.\n\nSo, after tough primary battles, both parties are facing the question of how to work together against each in the general election this fall.", "27": "After a week of nonstop criticism from Democrats and Republicans alike for comments many condemned as racially charged, Donald Trump claims to be altering his campaign to be a little more inclusive. While the presumptive G.O.P. has long promised to \u201cmake America great again,\u201d Trump now says he\u2019s adding two words to slogan to illustrate just how non-racist he really is.\n\n\u201cYou know, I have the theme \u2018make America great again,\u2019 and I've added a couple of things,\u201d Trump announced to supporters at a campaign rally in Richmond, Virginia, on Friday night. \u201cRight now I\u2019m adding make America great again\u2014I\u2019m adding \u2018for everyone,\u2019 because it\u2019s really going to be for everyone. It\u2019s not going to be for a group of people, it\u2019s going to be for everyone. It\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nThe allegedly amended slogan, which has yet to appear on any official signage or Trump merchandise, comes after the presidential candidate spent the first half of June repeatedly denouncing Gonzalo Curiel, the federal judge of Mexican heritage presiding over the Trump University class action lawsuit, as inherently biased against him. (Curiel was born in Indiana.) His comments were widely condemned by the Washington political establishment, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who suggested he may be an idiot, and House Speaker Paul Ryan, who called Trump\u2019s statement the \u201ctextbook definition of a racist comment.\u201d\n\nTrump, who hasn\u2019t apologized or taken back any of his comments, indicated on Friday that he realized his words have had a negative effect on his campaign and declared he is not a racist.\n\n\u201cI am the least racist person. The least racist person that you\u2019ve ever seen. I mean give me a break,\u201d he said at the rally. \u201cI am the least racist person that you\u2019ve ever looked at, believe me.\u201d", "28": "If you want a glimpse into a presidential candidate\u2019s governing style, take a look at his campaign. How does he build an organization? How does he manage personnel? How does he delegate responsibility? Does he value loyalty or honesty in advisers? It\u2019s hardly conclusive, but how a candidate deals with these challenges says a lot about what they\u2019d prioritize as president.\n\nThe presumptive Republican nominee has managed his campaign the way he manages his casinos or his realty TV program: haphazardly and with an unearned arrogance. Everything\u2019s about the brand and non-sycophants are cast aside. Getting it right is far less important than being right. Thus, when prompted by advisers to\u00a0dial down the rhetoric and think more about his long-term viability, Trump has resisted. He\u2019s yet to understand how different a primary and a general election are, and he\u2019s too cocksure to listen to anyone who tries to explain it.\n\nTrump isn\u2019t as stupid as he pretends to be, but his confidence seems to scale with his ignorance, and that\u2019s a dangerous trait in a president, given how consequential each decision can be.\u00a0As a candidate, a confident idiot can make a lot of noise and fool a lot of voters. But you can\u2019t lead that way. As president, Trump would need the sober advice of serious professionals. Considering how little he understands about the job and the world, this is especially true in his case.\n\nBased on the latest behind-the-scenes reports on Trump\u2019s campaign (as well as his entire history in real estate and television), it\u2019s unlikely he would govern with the humility and self-awareness required. The campaign has undergone several shake-ups in recent months, with key staffers like Corey Lewandowski being demoted to make way for veteran operatives like Paul Manafort. Trump\u2019s approach has remained very much the same, however. Everyone he brings in bends to his will or is replaced by someone who does.\n\nThings have gotten more chaotic in the last week or so, as Rick Wiley was fired as the campaign\u2019s national political director. Wiley was known to assert himself in ways that alienated Trump and his loyalists.\u00a0The Washington Post\u2019s Sean Sullivan and Robert Costa summarized the broader situation\u00a0over the weekend: \u201cFor the last two months, Donald Trump has presided over a political team riddled with turf wars, staff reshuffling and dueling power centers. But tensions are more than typical campaign chaos: They illustrate how Trump likes to run an organization, whether it\u2019s a real estate venture or his presidential bid. Interviews with current and former Trump associates reveal an executive who is fond of promoting rivalries among subordinates, wary of delegating major decisions, scornful of convention and fiercely insistent on a culture of loyalty around him.\u201d These are the management techniques of a brand-hustling magnate, not a president of the United States. Trump\u2019s dictatorial approach works well on the campaign trail, but it\u2019d be a disaster in office. A president has to persuade and compromise. The capacity to admit ignorance is equally important. Trump, by all accounts, has no interest in any of these things. Trump doesn\u2019t know what he needs to know in order to be president, nor does he care that he doesn\u2019t know. If his campaign is any indication, he\u2019ll hire people to ensure his veil of ignorance is never cracked. That kind of megalomania is why Trump is who he is \u2013 it\u2019s part of his outsized persona. It\u2019s also the clearest indicator we have of the kind of president he\u2019d be.", "29": "Syrian War Report \u2013 October 31, 2016: Al-Nusra-led Forces Failed to Break Aleppo Siege \u2039 \u203a South Front Analysis & Intelligence is a public analytical project maintained by an independent team of experts from the four corners of the Earth focusing on international relations issues and crises. They focus on analysis and intelligence of the ongoing crises and the biggest stories from around the world: Ukraine, the war in Middle East, Central Asia issues, protest movements in the Balkans, migration crises, and others. In addition, they provide military operations analysis, the military posture of major world powers, and other important data influencing the growth of tensions between countries and nations. We try to dig out the truth on issues which are barely covered by governments and mainstream media. Syrian War Report \u2013 November 1, 2016: Syrian Military Deploys Advanced T-90 Battle Tanks to Aleppo By South Front on November 1, 2016 \u2026from SouthFront \nThe Syrian military has deployed advanced Russian-made T-90 main battle tanks to western Aleppo, according to the video released on October 31. T-90 MBTs were observed in the Minyan area where they were participating in operations against Jaish al-Fatah, a Jabhat al-Nusra-led coalition of militant groups. Last weekend, elite units of the Syrian Army\u2019s Tiger Forces and the Desert Hawks Brigade were deployed in Aleppo to counter the militants\u2019 offensive operation to capture the al-Assad Military Academy and the nearby areas. Both formations operate T-90 MBTs supplied by Moscow over the last year. The government forces massively use tanks, artillery, warplanes and helicopters to attrit Jaish al-Fatah\u2019s manpower in non-populated urban areas. \nExperts note that the jihadists have also concentrated a high number of experienced troops, artillery, rocket launchers and military equipment at a restricted front in western Aleppo. To do this, they had been pushed to use almost all their resources from the rear bases in Idlib province. If Jabhat al-Nusra is not able to achieve a decided success in clashes with the government forces soon, this will lead to its total collapse as a powerbroker in the war. The group\u2019s material and technical base will be destroyed and experienced troops and field commanders killed in the clashes. We\u2019ve been already able to observe signs of this tendency since the failed al-Nusra attempt to dig in the Ramouseh Artillery Acandemy in southern Aleppo. \nThe Kurdish YPG and the Ankara-led forces (Turkish-backed militant groups and the Turkish Armed Forces) have been competing in the northeastern countryside of Aleppo city. Both forces recently captured a bunch of villages from ISIS in the direction of Al-Bab. In this case, the ongoing coordination between the Syrian army and the YPG has once again become reality on the ground. The recent Kurdish operations were coordinated and supported by the Russian and Syrian military and military sources say that Moscow increased military supplies to the YPG in the area. Moscow and Domascus believe that the Kurdish buffer zone plays an important role, preventing Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki and other pro-Turkish groups from attacking the Syrian army and its allies in Aleppo city. In mid-October Harakat Nour al-Din al-Zenki officially announced that the next stage of Turkey\u2019s Operation Euphrates Shield will include an advance on the \u2018regime forces\u2019 in Aleppo. \nDozens of al-Nusra Front and linked-groups members were killed during their failed attempt to break the Syrian army\u2019s defenses at the abandoned al-Mahjoorah Battalion military camp near the militant-controlled town of Ibtaa in the province of Daraa on October 31. According to pro-government forces over 40 militants were killed. Pro-militant media outlets confirm 26 killed in action terrorists.

And it does so in a miraculous pattern that is reflected from the cosmos to the super organism, our Earth and to each of us in our divine vessel, the human body. From his website: http://cytocosmos.com \n\u201cMetabiology is a study of the invisible systems of life spanning from the subatomic to the celestial. [\u2026] By using cell biology as a template, we are able to map elements within the cell to elements of unseen systems. The latter elements are obtained by cross referencing multiple sources of material from the OBE/LBL/NDE experiencer community. These so-called astral systems map quite nicely to systems in the cell, and they tell the same narrative, albeit the complexity and sophistication of cellular earth is many times that of the cell. \nMuch of the understandings derived from such mappings are echoed in the deeper cosmologies and teachings of the ancient world religions. Examples include; Sumerian, Egyptian, Kabbalah, Gnostic, Kashmir Shivaism, and Vedanta. Jungian Psychology has also proven to be useful in mapping out the cellular psyche. \nThis is the science of \u201cas above, so below\u201d in a very literal sense. The invisible is inner visible within the generalized cell itself. We can therefore grasp and ground the unseen systems of life by mapping them to the empirical biology of the cell. The implications of what this science has to offer reach all the way from psychology to cosmology and particle physics. \nThe primary tenet of Metabiology is that we have inherited biology from systems of life that exist both above and before us. Should it be surprising? After all, we are children of the living universe. The Cytocosmos is a multidimensional living fractal, a cellular holarchy that has hitherto been called the universe.\u201d \nRandy Maugans is the beloved radio show host of \u2018Offplanet Radio\u2019 http://radio.offplanetmedia.net/ Who doesn\u2019t pull his punches speaking his truth.

And while that advice is still valid, I neglected a very important concept in that first article: the techniques that detail how to stretch.\nI am not referring to a specific stretch or some sort of hypothetical \u201cstretching mindset,\u201d but rather a set of techniques that can be utilized for any stretch to increase ones flexibility immediately. But before I can discuss those, I have to discuss the incorrect way of stretching that many people still use.\nHow Not To Stretch Many people believe that stretching is a literal act of forcing the muscles and connective tissue to stretch\u2014 avoid this at all costs ! First and foremost, as I have discussed previously in these pages, you should never apply any stretching pressure to the connective tissue. They evolved solely to \u201chold fast\u201d and keep things in one piece, they should never be stretched at all!\nThe muscles are the anatomical feature that stretches, as they evolved to do. When stretching, your body should always be positioned in a way where the connective tissues are stable and the muscles are moving.\nEven when you are positioned properly, no part of stretching should involve the athlete forcing his muscles to stretch, as that risks muscular tearing which is a nagging injury that never truly goes away. This is because the human body has naturally evolved what is referred to as the \u201c anti-stretch reflex \u201d to prevent muscular tearing-stretching the muscles increases in difficulty the farther and deeper the stretch is, and your body responds to this stress with pain. This is a biological sign telling you that if you go further you\u2019ll be risking muscle tears, and should normally be a heeded warning.\nHowever, if you want to do advanced stretching (such as that nigh-impossible benchmark of fitness the splits), you will have to find a way to overcome this reflex without hurting yourself. And as luck would have it, there is!\n\nRelax Into Stretching Reflexes can be overcome with gradual and repeated practice\u2014just ask your friendly neighborhood hooker about how she overcame her gag reflex! Similarly, your anti-stretch reflex that keeps your \u201cjoints\u201d (actually your muscles) stiff and immobile can be overcome with a few techniques.\nThe most basic of these techniques is the one that I have had the best results with (as usual, the simple but difficult answer is usually the correct one), and that is the titular concept of \u201crelaxing into a stretch\u201d\u2014with thanks to Pavel Tsatsouline for naming the concept.\nTo use this technique, take an easy form of the stretch you want to do: using the splits as an example, you would do a seated groin stretch. Engage the stretch just to the point where you feel tension in the target muscle, and then\u2026sit and wait.\n\nYes, paradoxically, relaxation is the key to increasing your physical fitness in this context. You are literally going to sit there and wait for your muscles to stop fighting the stretch\u2014in other words, you\u2019re going to exhaust your reflex until it stops being reflexive.\nThis is not something that happens quickly\u2014from my experience, it will take 5-10 minutes per stretch, so it is perfectly acceptable for you to get a book or watch TV while doing this. As a side note, this is literally the only time where it\u2019s acceptable to have a visual distraction during exercise, in my opinion.\nAs you might expect, once your muscles have relaxed and the pain has melted away, you can increase the stretch a little bit more, and hold it for another 10 minutes. Repeat this process until your muscles are in pain and you judge that you can\u2019t go any further\u2014this is a personal call that you will have to decide for yourself, as I can\u2019t judge when your muscles are demanding you to stop.\nThis technique can be utilized for any stretch, and in many cases will give you the progress that you so desire. However, there are other methods in the \u201cRelax Into Stretch\u201d family of exercises that can be utilized as well, such as meditation\u2014mentally relaxing will lead to muscular relaxation.\nOr you can try \u201cforced relaxation\u201d, where you flex the muscle simultaneously while stretching, forcing the muscle to relax.\n\nEither way you slice it, don\u2019t just brute force your stretching, utilize these techniques for better results.\nRead More: Why Stretching Is Essential For The Body (With 6 Beginner Stretches To Get You Started) \n", "33": "Britain and EU After Brexit ( 31 ) 0 13 0 0 Brexit prompts the Unietd Kingdom to facilitate trade relations with non-EU states including Russia, the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce (RBCC) chairman told Sputnik. \nMOSCOW (Sputnik) \u2014 Leaving the European Union and losing access to the single market encourages Britain to develop trade with Russia and other non-EU states, Roger Munnings, the Russo-British Chamber of Commerce (RBCC) chairman, told Sputnik on Wednesday. \"There are at least two years to go before we leave the European Union, but I think the way Britain is looking at it is that it gives us a chance to be completely open to all countries in the world, including Russia.

I like a potential trend with revealing e-mails, but want a breakthrough that causes arrests of our .01% leaders in elegant endgame. \nS: Yes, and I\u2019d like to fly, breath underwater swimming like a dolphin, and have daily dinner parties with wine, music and women! \nC: (mock agreement) Me, too! \nOk, our wants aren\u2019t our best guides, necessarily. \nI do have to go to work. Back to \u201cearning a living.\u201d \nS: Make the most of it. It\u2019s your given area of self-expression. \nC: I promise. I\u2019ll lead by example of my best good-faith expression and experience of virtue. \nAnother day. \nS: Perhaps just another day. Perhaps you can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s coming. \nC: Human limitations. I\u2019ll work with what I see. \nS: That\u2019s all I concluded was possible. That\u2019s all I got for wisdom.

Bush/Cheney exceeded their lawlessness. Obama outdid the worst of both previous administrations - attacking seven countries, destabilizing others, orchestrating coups in Honduras, Paraguay and Brazil, threatening Venezuelan democracy, enforcing puppet rule in Haiti, continuing Plan Colombia aid, responsible for massacres, disappearances and torture of regime opponents, along with instituting increasingly anti-Sino/Russia policies, risking confrontation with both countries. On October 27, the Wall Street Journal said 2016 electoral politics \u0093scrambled traditional positions on foreign policy and international intervention, obliterating many of the usual partisan distinctions and presenting political challenges for whoever wins in November.\u0094 Hillary will likely exceed the worst of Obama\u0092s aggressiveness \u0093on the international stage, according to her public statements and (what) top aides\u0094 say. She\u0092ll be more hardline on Russia, China and Iran, risking direct confrontation. Earlier she said \u0093I think I\u0092ve been very clear that my position is in favor of what I called smart power that uses all the tools at our disposal, and military power always should be a last resort.\u0094 Her views as first lady, US senator and secretary of state show how often she favors it aggressively, her rage for wars insatiable. As president and commander-in-chief, she\u0092ll likely circumvent international and constitutional law like her predecessors, waging war on any nation she chooses. Former acting CIA director Michael Morell, a likely Hillary administration appointee, urges a more muscular US geopolitical role, including new sanctions on Russia and Iran, earlier saying: \u0093Ships leave Iran on a regular basis carrying arms to the Houthis in Yemen. I would have no problem from a policy perspective of having the US Navy boarding their ships and if there are weapons on them to turn those ships around.\u0094 This type aggressiveness would risk greater Middle East war than already, maybe involving Russia and China, challenging US interventionism - knowing their nations are next if it\u0092s not stopped. Earlier, Hillary\u0092s top national security advisor Jake Sullivan said \u0093(w)e need to be raising the costs to Iran for its destabilizing behavior, and we need to be raising the confidence of our Sunni partners.\u0094 Last year\u0092s nuclear deal failed to change overall US policy toward Iran - wanting pro-Western puppet governance replacing its sovereign independence. Instead of cooperating with Iran in furthering regional peace and stability, a Hillary administration appears planning to challenge it confrontationally - perhaps with another war in mind, a far greater challenge than against other Middle East states, especially with Russia likely to intervene if asked.

Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) has written a book on the subject, \u201cAmerican Dreams: Restoring Economic Opportunity for Everyone,\u201d to be published this week, while Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) has proposed policies for distressed communities that he sees as \u201cthe ticket to the middle class.\u201d\n\nAnd Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee who was portrayed by Democrats as insensitive to and out of touch with the lives of middle- and working-class Americans, has told friends he considers poverty a topic du jour as he weighs another run in 2016.\n\n\u201cYou talk to any pollster, on the Democratic side or the Republican side, they\u2019re in complete agreement on the idea that there has to be an economic populist message,\u201d said Matthew Dowd, a top strategist for former president George W. Bush\u2019s 2000 and 2004 campaigns. \u201cThen it comes down to \u2018Are there credible solutions and is there a credible candidate?\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\nAbout 45\u00a0million Americans live at or below the poverty line, according to last fall\u2019s census estimates, while the median household income in the United States in 2013 was just under $52,000. Adjusted for inflation, the median is 8\u00a0percent lower than it was in 2007, the last full year before the recession, and 11\u00a0percent below what it was in 2000.\n\nWage stagnation has been a persistent problem for low- and middle-income workers. \u201cSince the late 1970s, wages for the bottom 70\u00a0percent of earners have been essentially stagnant, and between 2009 and 2013, real \u00adwages fell for the entire bottom 90 percent of the wage distribution,\u201d Lawrence Mishel of the liberal Economic Policy Institute wrote in a paper published this month.\n\nLaunching his new political action committee, Right to Rise, Jeb Bush asserted last week in the PAC\u2019s mission statement that President Obama\u2019s tenure has been \u201cpretty good\u201d for those at the top of the income scale but a \u201clost decade\u201d for everyone else.\n\n\u201cMillions of our fellow citizens across the broad middle class feel as if the American Dream is now out of their reach; that our politics are petty and broken; that opportunities are elusive; and that the playing field is no longer fair or level,\u201d Bush wrote. \u201cToo many of the poor have lost hope that a path to a better life is within their grasp.\u201d\n\nBush\u2019s focus adds an unexpected element to the coming debate and puts pressure on the entire field, himself included, to come forward with fresh policies that address the nation\u2019s core economic problems.\n\nThe shift also highlights a potential vulnerability for Democrats. In his campaigns, Obama twice promised to focus on wealth inequality and middle-class stagnation, but those problems persist even as the economy revs up and unemployment falls.\n\nClinton could be challenged now from both the right and the left to lay out solutions that go beyond Obama\u2019s \u2014 and also to develop a political voice of her own to articulate them. Democrats conceded after last fall\u2019s midterm elections that they had not found a compelling economic message.\n\nDemocrats will look to Clinton, should she run, to take the lead in doing that \u2014 although they also are looking to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and her harder-edged populist rhetoric.\n\nClinton tested such a message last year. In a major speech at the New America Foundation in May, she said that Americans are \u201cfinding it harder than ever to get their footing in our changing economy. The dream of upward mobility that made this country a model for the world feels further and further out of reach.\u201d\n\nThe language of Bush, Rubio and other Republicans appears aimed at avoiding the problem that bedeviled Romney throughout his 2012 campaign. The former Massachusetts governor\u2019s memorable comment about the \u201c47 percent\u201d of the population who he said depend on government and feel like victims haunted him during the final months before the election.\n\nYuval Levin, editor of the conservative journal National Affairs, said the overall shift in emphasis by Republicans is an effort to move away from Romney\u2019s more abstract message of job growth and to focus more specifically on social mobility and solutions for those at or near the bottom.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a process of letting the light out from under the bushel,\u201d Levin said. Citing past conservative leadership in reforming welfare, he added: \u201cI think Republican ideas have always held this promise, but conservatives have not always emphasized these elements. .\u2009.\u2009. A difference in emphasis is not insignificant.\u201d\n\nDemocrats, however, argue that revising their rhetoric will not be enough for Republicans \u2014 especially if Jeb Bush becomes the GOP nominee \u2014 to gloss over former president George W. Bush\u2019s legacy, which Democrats say tightened the middle-class squeeze.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like the Republican Party has clean hands on the issue of rising inequality,\u201d said Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and an adviser to Clinton on economic policy. \u201cIt\u2019s a weird thing to say, \u2018I care about how the rest of the country is doing, not just the top earners,\u2019 when your brother cut taxes for the wealthy and your party\u2019s economic position starts with undoing Dodd-Frank,\u201d the 2010 law that tightened regulation of Wall Street.\n\nObama hit the road last week to highlight economic successes of his presidency, from the auto industry bailout to more robust overall growth in the last half of 2014. Still, many Democrats acknowledge that there is a large gap between promise and results on issues of middle-class insecurities.\n\nThat is where Bush and some other Republicans are taking aim. Two factors have contributed to the opening they see.\n\nOne is the continued problem of stagnating wages for the broad middle class and the income gap between rich and non-rich. The other is new evidence that it has become harder for those at the bottom to rise into the middle class, and that the risk of some born into the middle class \u2014 particularly minorities \u2014 falling out of it is growing.\n\nDemocrats long have been seen as the party more trusted to deal with middle-class economic issues. Republicans long have resisted policies that smack of economic redistribution. Could that be changing?\n\n\u201cHow do you tell the middle class, \u2018We\u2019re your guy?\u2019\u2009\u201d said Grover Norquist, a conservative anti-tax advocate. \u201cRepublicans feel comfortable saying that now because they feel the guys they\u2019re running against are sufficiently discredited.\u201d\n\nWilliam Galston of the Brookings Institution said that the issue of blocked social mobility is one Republicans will feel more comfortable engaging \u2014 and on their own terms. \u201cThat\u2019s what Jeb Bush is saying: \u2018We can accept a definition of a problem .\u2009.\u2009. but give unabashedly conservative responses to those challenges,\u2019\u2009\u201d he said.\n\nBut Galston, a former domestic policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, said Bush\u2019s framing of the issue this way means he has put down a marker that he will be expected to meet.\n\n\u201cI would expect to hear from him over the coming months some of the best and most innovative conservative thinking on opportunity and upward mobility,\u201d he said. \u201cThat will be a fair test on how much gas there is in the conservative ideas tank.\u201d\n\nOther Republicans have been working to reorient their party toward blue-collar economics and to put forward fresh economic ideas. Former senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and former Arkansas governor Mike Huckabee, two former presidential candidates who are looking at running in 2016, long have talked about the GOP\u2019s need to recognize the problems of working families.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee Chairman Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) has focused on policies designed to lift people out of poverty. In 2012, as Romney\u2019s running mate, Ryan wanted to campaign in inner cities and give speeches promoting individual empowerment. He was frustrated that Romney\u2019s campaign team directed him to talk about other topics.\n\nRubio has proposed a fundamental shift in anti-poverty programs. He has suggested devolving power and responsibility from Washington to the states by consolidating federal monies into a \u201cflex fund.\u201d The senator from Florida has called for significant reductions in federal regulations that he says will spur creation of better jobs. On education, he has offered a series of reforms designed to lessen the burden of student loan debt and expand access to apprenticeship programs. Rubio and others also have proposed changes in the earned-income tax credit to extend its reach to more people.\n\nDemocrats are skeptical that Republicans can meet the challenge with policy proposals that are much beyond calls for tax cuts to spur economic growth and further efforts to scale back the size of government.\n\n\u201cIt sounds to me like a \u00adtraditional Romney Republican \u00adtrickle-down agenda but with a willingness to engage on inequality and mobility,\u201d said Jared Bernstein, a former adviser to Vice President Biden who works at the Center of Budget and Policy Priorities.\n\nDemocrats say it\u2019s too early to draw conclusions, but they note that if Bush and other Republicans find new ways to engage middle-class voters with populist themes, the pressures on Clinton will mount significantly.\n\n\u201cVoters are going to [say], \u2018Okay, thank you for acknowledging this problem, but what are you going to do about it?\u2019\u2009\u201d Bernstein said. \u201cI would argue that Democrats are going to have to have more in their toolbox than [raising the] minimum wage and universal pre-K.\u201d", "41": "NEW YORK -- Bye bye June rate hike. That was the billboard-size\u00a0headline from Wall Street trading desks after the U.S. job-creation machine hit the wall in May. The government said 38,000 jobs were created in May, way, way, way\u00a0\u00a0below the roughly 160,000 new positions Wall Street economists had been expecting.\n\nIt was the worst month for job creation since September 2010.\n\nThe Janet Yellen-led Federal Reserve had been driving home the message that it was \"appropriate\" to hike interest rates in coming months \u2013\u00a0and perhaps as early as June \u2013\u00a0IF the job market and economy continued to perform well and meet their more upbeat forecast.\n\nBut the May\u00a0jobs report was bad. Really bad.\n\n\"Horrible,\" is the word used by Steven Ricchiuto, chief economist at MSUSA. \"Very weak,\" chimed in Chris Gaffney, president of world markets at EverBank. Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, tweeted out that\u00a0the lousy jobs number amounted to a \u00a0\"bombshell.\"\n\nA bombshell, indeed. So weak was the 38,000 May job count, that Wall Street now sees virtually a zero chance of the Fed moving at its June meeting, which breaks up on June 15.\n\n\"This is the weakest number of workers added in almost six years,\" Gaffney told USA TODAY via e-mail.\n\nAfter the dreadful jobs report was released, the odds of a June hike plunged to about 4%, down sharply from 19% before the data were\u00a0released, according to futures markets tracked by the CME Group.\n\n\"Just when they thought it was safe to go back into the water,\" the Fed gets hit with this less-than-stellar data point on jobs, Ricchiuto told clients in a report.\u00a0\"This now assures that June is off the table, but may not rule out July.\"\n\nBut professional investors are still not willing to rule out a hike in July \u2013\u00a0at least not yet as there is a lot of economic data to come between now and July.\u00a0The chances of a July hike plunged to 34% from close to 60%.\n\nThe market reaction was swift. Stocks dipped\u00a0as investors now have to worry about a possible slowdown in job creation, which is a negative for the economy. \"Risks about the strength of the U.S. economy outweigh the positive impacts of lower interest rates,\" Gaffney said.\n\nBond yields fell, as investors piled back into U.S. government bonds as the threat of an imminent Fed rate hike fade. The U.S. dollar weakened as the Fed's rate-hike timetable gets pushed back.\n\nSure the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.7%. But while that number sounds good it is mainly due to \"another big drop in the labor force,\" says Paul Ashworth, chief U.S. economist at Capital Economics.\n\nYellen is scheduled to speak on Monday, Ashworth adds. Wall Street will be listening \u2013\u00a0closely.\n\n\"Yellen should provide more insight on the Fed's thinking Monday,\" he said via e-mail.", "42": "Real Disclosure!

The costs of these leaks since 2006 has amounted to $4.7 billion.\n1. Oklahoma: On Oct. 24, the 30-inch S-1 pipeline carrying crude oil from the critical Cushing, Oklahoma hub to refineries and chemical plants on the Gulf Coast began to leak and was shut down overnight. It was the second release connected with the Cushing storage facility in less than a month.\n2. Pennsylvania: On Oct. 21, 55,000 gallons of gasoline gushed from a ruptured Sunoco Logistics pipeline in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, just upstream from the Susquehanna River. Carol Parenzan, Middle Susquehanna Riverkeeper , said that witnesses who contacted her office reported that the \u201csmell of petroleum is so thick you can taste it.\u201d The 80-year old pipeline was damaged by a heavy storm that dumped seven inches of rain on the area.\n3. Alabama: Last month, the Colonial Pipeline in Alabama leaked an estimated 336,000 gallons of gasoline and triggered concerns about gas shortages for drivers in the East. That spill was Colonial\u2019s fifth in the state this year and occurred on a 43-year old section of the pipeline.\nBased on data from the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA), an arm of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the number of significant pipeline incidents grew 26.8 percent from 2006 to 2015. A significant incident is defined as one that results in serious injury or fatality, costs more than $50,000, releases more than five barrels of volatile fluids such as gasoline or 50 barrels of other liquids, or results in a fire or explosion. In 2015, there were 326 such incidents\u2014almost one per day.\nSome 55 percent of the U.S. network of 135,000 miles of pipeline is more than 45 years old. Technology designed to detect pipeline leaks is highly unreliable, even though companies like Colonial Pipeline tout their use as a way \u201cto insure safe operations.\u201d But a recent Reuters report found that these technologies are \u201cabout as successful as a random member of the public\u201d finding a leak. Of 466 incidents studied by Reuters, only 22 percent, or 105, were detected by advanced detection systems. The others were found in different ways, with the public finding 99 of the leaks.\nIn testimony before a House subcommittee earlier this year, Carl Weimer, executive director of the watchdog group Pipeline Safety Trust , said, \u201cUnder the current statutes there is no requirement that a pipeline company obtain any permit or permission to operate a pipeline in this country.\u201d Weimer called on Congress to require PHMSA to issue permits for interstate transmission pipelines and ensure that the company follow all rules and regulations.\n\u201cIt is important that we not only maintain our aging energy infrastructure, but that we also remain vigilant about new pipelines and energy interests that threaten water quality,\u201d said Parenzan.\nDan Zukowski \u2014 Environmental journalist and nature photographer.

This is an uncommon turnaround for a president who hasn\u2019t changed his mind on foreign policy since drawing his (much-ballyhooed and promptly ignored) \u201cred line\u201d in Syria.\n\nSo what does this rare shift have to say about Obama\u2019s foreign policy and America\u2019s future role in Afghanistan? Not much.\n\nMr. Obama started his presidency hoping to use Afghanistan to demonstrate his willingness to roll up his sleeves and get his hands dirty in the national security business. He asserted that, unlike \u201cBush\u2019s War\u201d in Iraq, fighting in the place where the 9/11 attacks were concocted was worth it.\n\nIn approving a surge in Afghanistan, the president made much of his role as decider-in-chief. Yet, even as he sent in more troops, he tipped his hand that Afghanistan was not as much an exception to the talk-don\u2019t-fight Obama Doctrine as the tough-guy image he sought to cultivate.\n\nThe president gave commanders only half the force and half the time they requested to do the job right. It turned out, the commanders were right.\u00a0 Mr. Obama, however, had his eye on the next election and wanted to go into the race showing he had put the war on a glide-path to wind down and pull out.\n\nSignaling a limited-time interest in fighting an enemy rarely ends well. The Taliban adopted the logical and predictable strategy of simply waiting out Mr. Obama. Also predictably, the half-measure surge and overly ambitious transfer of responsibility to the Afghan military resulted in unnecessarily heavy casualties for Afghan security forces, a persistent Taliban, and a shaky security situation.\n\nNevertheless, Afghanistan is far from a total failure. Indeed, \u00a0compared to the president\u2019s other foreign policy dalliances\u2014from the Russian \u201creset\u201d to Libya to Syria to Iraq to Ukraine\u2014 it ranks as his best achievement yet.\n\nWhich is why Mr. Obama is reportedly backing away from his plan to yank virtually all U.S. troops out of Afghanistan by the end of next year. Instead, he has agreed to leave the current force of 9,800 troops in place throughout \u201cmost\u201d of next year, and keep 5,500 in theater thereafter.\n\nIt\u2019s a good call. With the Taliban flexing its muscles anew and the Islamic State making inroads there, completely pulling out makes little sense. Mr. Obama can ill afford another complete foreign policy disaster on his watch.\u00a0 Further, virtually everyone \u2013the U.S. military, the Afghans, Pakistan, India, our NATO allies\u2014 wants the U.S. to stay and see the job through.\n\nIn addition, there is zero domestic pressure for the president to make good on his campaign promise. An appearance of Code Pink is about as common as a Yeti sighting. And in the debates thus far, presidential candidates have devoted about as much time to Afghanistan as they have to defunding Public Television.\n\nIt makes complete sense for Mr. Obama to tough it out in Afghanistan, but don\u2019t expect the change in plans to make things better for the Afghans or the larger security picture. The U.S. presence is the bare minimum to hold on. More forces with loser rules of engagement would make the country much safer, much faster.\n\nBut holding on is probably the best we can hope for with this president.\u00a0 Here\u2019s hoping the next Commander in Chief\u2019s attitude toward Afghanistan will focus more on solving problems than just wishing they would go away.\n\nJames Jay Carafano is vice president of foreign and defense policy studies \u00a0The Heritage Foundation.

", "50": "For a long time in American politics, we've been trapped in a cycle of ever-escalating political polarization. As measured by voting patterns in the US Congress, the two parties have pulled apart to distances we've never seen before. As measured by consistent partisan positioning among voters, the split in the electorate has reached a historic level of divisiveness.\n\nBut this is about to end. We've now hit peak polarization. The forces that have fueled the widening gap between the two political parties are now fueling fights within the two political parties, fights that will lead to new coalitions in American politics, eventually realigning the two parties. A new era of American politics is about to emerge.\n\nThe tautological reason polarization has increased in American politics is that over the past four decades, conflict in American politics has increasingly operated along a single dimension: Republican versus Democrat. A large number of issues that were once nonpartisan or non-ideological have become partisan issues. Almost every policy has now been swept into the maw of partisan jockeying, leaving almost no space for the cross-partisan cooperation our political system relies on to function.\n\nIn order for congressional polarization to persist, both parties have to maintain tight enough discipline over their members and the political agenda to ensure consistent party voting. And in order for public polarization to persist, parties have to maintain tight enough message discipline among their elites to ensure that their voters only hear one main message.\n\nThis is breaking down. Republicans are now in open warfare between Trump supporters and #NeverTrumpers. Democrats are far less divided, but internal rifts between their \"establishment\" (Hillary Clinton) and \"insurgent\" (Bernie Sanders) wings are also real and likely lasting.\n\nThis conflict is emerging on issues of international trade, on questions of corporate (especially Wall Street) power, and in growing anger over money in politics and corruption generally. In short, parties are increasingly divided on a growing range of issues that pit their less-educated, lower-income voters who feel left behind by the current political-economic system against their better-educated, higher-income voter who don't want to mess too much with the status quo. These conflicts are not going away anytime soon.\n\nThis moment is the culmination of four interconnected but ultimately unsustainable trends that have turbocharged polarization over the last two decades:\n\nClose competition fueled partisan nastiness and increased the demand for campaign money. The demand for campaign money made the parties more dependent on wealthy donors, which made them less responsive to their voters. This lack of responsiveness provided plenty of evidence for corruption and the felt sense that politics was broken, which fueled anger. Both parties attempted to channel this anger against the other party to distract from their own failures and contradictions and win elections by rendering the other party toxic. This exacerbated the sense that politics was broken and corrupt.\n\nThese trends created contradictions, and now these contradictions have created openings. Ambitious candidates who could get past their parties' campaign finance gatekeepers had a lot of angry and left-behind voters eager for their message. And this is precisely what Sanders and especially Donald Trump have accomplished. Now there is no going back.\n\nThese are big claims. So let's flesh this story out a little more, this time with expanded detail.\n\nThe story could go all the way back to the decisive election of 1932, when Democrats became the dominant party in American politics for a generation, holding together a big-tent New Deal coalition that included Southern pro-segregationists with Northern urban progressives. But it was an uneasy alliance that could only last as long as civil rights legislation was bottled up. Then in 1964, the Democrats decidedly became the party of civil rights. And as Lyndon Johnson allegedly acknowledged upon signing the 1964 Civil Rights Act, the Democrats \"have lost the South for a generation.\"\n\nDemocrats had controlled the South ever since Republican-led Reconstruction (since Republicans were the party of Lincoln and of Reconstruction). But as Republicans came to be the party better aligned with the South on issues of race, conservative Republicans replaced conservative Democrats in Southern House and Senate seats, starting in the 1980s. By 1995, when Republicans won the House for the first time in 40 years, this transition was mostly complete. By 2011, it was absolute and total.\n\nAs this all happened, the ideological center of the Republican Party moved to the South, fusing social and economic conservatism. Northern liberal Republicans were marginalized and soon endangered. Democrats, meanwhile, lost their Southern, conservative wing, and the ideological center of the Democratic Party moved to the coasts and big cities, fusing social and economic liberalism.\n\nAs the parties became less internally diverse, individual members of Congress delegated more power to their party leaders. After all, they all now basically agreed on the issues. And they wanted leaders who could punish disloyal dissenters and control the agenda. So when Newt Gingrich took over the speakership in 1995, he centralized power in the position in a way it had not been centralized since 1910.\n\nIn the 1990s, American politics entered a somewhat unusual period of remarkably close two-party competition for control of the House and the Senate.\n\nThis, as political scientist Frances Lee explains, has been the catalyst for a very nasty brand of partisan fighting.\n\nThis seems exactly right to me, and there's lots of evidence to prove it.\n\nBut not only has this close competition fueled partisanship by turning legislating into zero-sum trench warfare, it has also turbocharged the fundraising dimension of political campaigning.\n\nParties are campaigning harder than ever to win over those swing seats, and this has meant raising ever-expanding sums of money. And in order to raise this money, both parties have had to lean more and more on their wealthiest donors.\n\nBut relying on these wealthy donors created a problem for both parties. On many issues, particularly economic issues, wealthy elites hold separate opinions from most voters.\n\nMajor Republican donors generally want fiscal austerity, and particularly a rolled-back welfare state. They also tend to be much more pro-immigration and pro\u2013free trade than Republican voters, and not particularly worried about social issues. But schemes like privatizing Social Security and voucherizing Medicare have never been all that popular with actual Republican voters. And as the middle classes' wages have stagnated, especially for those without college degrees, and the share of foreign-born residents in the US has reached levels not seen since the 1920s (it hit 13.9 percent in 2015), the voting constituency for anti-immigration populism has grown considerably.\n\nDemocratic donors are somewhat more economically liberal. But they are not about to support Sanders-style socialism. They prefer Clinton's generally pro-market views. They will tolerate some regulation of business, but not that much, particularly when it's the tech and new economy businesses that they run and invest in.\n\nWhereas Democrats once relied on labor unions to get out the vote, by the 1990s unions could no longer provide the support Democrats needed. Democrats instead moved to depend on the \"professional class,\" deprioritizing workers' concerns to focus instead on the social and environmental concerns that went over much better in Hollywood and San Francisco and Manhattan fundraisers.\n\nFor a while, both parties could manage these contradictions, being responsive to their donors while pooh-poohing the economic concerns of their less affluent voters on the bland promise that a thriving economy was good for everyone. And for much of the 1990s and 2000s, the economy was doing okay, which generally kept voters from feeling too angry. And to the extent that individual voters weren't benefiting, it was, of course, the other party's fault.\n\nAs long as both sides were focused on the evils of the other side, and the economy was not in a major recession, party leaders could get away with ignoring many of their voters, and using the campaign contribution proceeds to make their case through more and more negative political advertising and aggressive media messaging.\n\nThis negativity translated into what political scientists Alan Abramowitz and Steven Webster call \"negative partisanship.\" As they explain:\n\nAll these interrelated trends have turbocharged polarization over the last two decades. But they relied on both sides being able to control the anger that they were stoking, and on both sides being able to convince their voters that all of the corruption and fecklessness in Washington was because of the other party. This could not go on indefinitely.\n\nIn fall 2008 the financial crisis hit, and the government bailed out the big Wall Street banks in a very public way. For many, this served as the decisive proof that things really were rigged: Washington and Wall Street were in a corrupt alliance, a conspiracy of career politicians and crony capitalists and lobbyists who were rolling in the money and laughing about it while everyone else was living paycheck to paycheck. As the economy stumbled through recession and then a jobless recovery, economic insecurity and political resentment increased.\n\nObama and the Democrats swept the 2008 election on the strength of anti-Bush feeling and the timeless energy of hope and change. For the first time since 1992, Democrats had unified control in Washington; Republicans were now out in the cold.\n\nWith their backs against the wall and Democrats as the new Washington establishment, Republicans now turned their anti-government rhetoric up to 11. Obama was Stalin. Obama was Hitler. Obama was a Kenyan-born Muslim bent on destroying America. Democrats responded to the charges with signature big-government legislation that taxed the middle class so that poor people could have government-subsidized health care. The Republican base went crazy. All their worst fears were confirmed.\n\nIn 2009, the Tea Party emerged, representing what felt like new anti-establishment radicalism but was really just the culmination of decades of Republican anti-government rhetoric now freed from any institutional responsibility for actually governing. In 2010, on the strength of Tea Party anti-Obama energy (and the fact that Democrats had won a bunch of majority Republican House districts in 2006 and 2008), Republicans swept back into control of the House. In the 2014 election, they finally won back the Senate.\n\nBut then nothing happened. Obamacare, the devil pi\u00f1ata of every Republican attack, was neither repealed nor replaced. Worse, Republican leaders were negotiating with Obama, Satan himself. They were letting Obama get away with an executive order on immigration. Here was the most corrupt, most crony capitalist administration in history, and what were Republicans in Congress doing? They were rolling over and being just as corrupt!\n\nIn June 2015, Donald Trump announced he was running for president and became the immediate frontrunner on the strength of his aggressive anti-immigration stance. Because he had his own money and his own media celebrity, Trump did not need to do the pro-austerity, pro-immigration, pro-free trade dance that other potential frontrunners had done to shake the big donor GOP money tree. He could just run for president, declaring everything was corrupt and he was the only one you could trust because he was the only one who didn't have a super PAC. And he could speak to the working-class Republican voters who had been left behind in this economy, by saying he'd go after China and give them Social Security and Medicare and go after the corrupt hedge fund rip-off artists.\n\nAnd they loved it. For decades, they had been told, for partisan reasons, to be angry; they had been told, for partisan reasons, that Washington was corrupt, and that all Washington politicians were evil. Now they finally had somebody who could say those things while actually not embodying any telltale signs of the sins. They also had somebody who could finally and authentically call out all the \"corrupt\" things Republican establishment types themselves were doing.\n\nA few months later, in September, Republican Speaker John Boehner announced he would resign from Congress, responding to efforts by the House Freedom Caucus to force him out. This was the first time since 1910 that an insurgent faction in the House had successfully challenged a sitting speaker. The anti-establishment anger that Republicans had courted had now finally turned on its leaders.\n\nOn the Democratic side, anti-Clinton progressives were hoping to draft Elizabeth Warren, who had demonstrated her anti-establishment bona fides in December 2014, sinking Obama's appointment of Wall Street banker Antonio Weiss for a top Treasury position (Weiss withdrew his nomination, instead accepting a counselor position to Secretary Jack Lew). Warren had also been a prominent opponent of Obama's major Asian free trade agreement.\n\nBut Warren didn't run. Instead, it was self-identified socialist Bernie Sanders who found the opening. Democratic donor gatekeepers had cleared the field for Hillary. This meant Sanders could get attention just for being the only real alternative, attention that he was able to snowball into a following. Sanders won't win the nomination. But he has done far, far better than anybody ever expected, because a sizable number of Democrat voters share his view that politics is a rigged game where the billionaires and the crony capitalists always win. And like Sanders, they are sick and tired of it.\n\nIf you briefly scroll back to the top of this article and look at the graph of polarization over time, you'll see a previous peak around 1910 or so. While historical analogies are never perfect, there are some notable similarities between now and around 1910.\n\nFor one, 1910 was the last time a sitting speaker of the US House had been effectively challenged from within the party. Second, in 1912 the Republican Party was so divided over its presidential nomination that the party splintered, with about half of Republicans supporting Howard Taft (the incumbent) and about half supporting Teddy Roosevelt (the previous incumbent). Democrat Woodrow Wilson won in a landslide.\n\nAround 1910 was also when the last great anti-establishment movement in America, the progressive movement, emerged in response to growing concentrations of wealth and political power, concentrations that many Americans felt had left them behind. As political scientist Grant McConnell once wrote of \"the progressive legacy,\" it consisted of a \"charges made against virtually all the institutions of American society\" with \"one common theme \u2014 corruption. ... Corruption of such prevalence, disorder of such magnitude could only be explained by something more than the assumption of a slow-spreading decay. The theory of conspiracy was ready at hand and in one way or another it was invoked as an explanation.\" This resonates with today's anti-establishment mood.\n\nPolitical scientist Hans Noel has argued that the emergence of the progressive movement \"crosscut the parties and eventually reshaped them.\" Noel notes that progressives opposed existing authority structures, both economically (e.g., the \"trusts\") and politically (they disliked political parties and other authority structures).\n\nIn 1910, it was progressive Republican George Norris who led the internal House revolt against Speaker Joe Cannon, stripping Cannon of most of his authority and devolving considerable powers back to individual members, who had increasingly chafed under their marginalization. Like John Boehner in 2015, Cannon in 1910 represented the culmination of exactly 20 years of increasingly centralized leadership control in the House speakership. Just as Gingrich had radically centralized control in 1995, Speaker Thomas Reed had radically centralized control in 1890.\n\nParties depolarized in the 1910s and 1920s because, freed of centralized leadership structures, more legislating happened in committees, where a cross-cutting progressive coalition could more freely operate independently of the two parties. Interestingly, trade policy also became much less polarized in the 1920s, with cross-party coalitions on tariff issues.\n\nMost likely, Trump will be the Republican nominee. Even if the #NeverTrump forces somehow wrest the nomination from him (unlikely, but possible), the anti-establishment forces in the Republican Party are not going away. If not Trump (though my guess is he will stick around for a while longer), somebody in the Tea Party, or possibly even Ted Cruz, will find a way to harness the Trump voters by following the Trump issues playbook. Where there are voters to be had, there are politicians to have them.\n\nMeanwhile, in Congress, House Speaker Paul Ryan is already having difficulty building consensus around a budget process. No matter how many speeches he gives about the importance of decorum in politics, it seems increasingly unlikely that he can reconcile the conflicts that Boehner failed to resolve, which means he will have to eventually lean on Democrats to pass a budget and, like Boehner before him, alienate some of his party. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, much less beloved even within his party, will face similar problems.\n\nMost likely, Hillary Clinton will become the 45th\u00a0US president (she has led in every single head-to-head poll against Trump). And most likely she will use her agenda-setting powers to try to force the Republicans into open civil war by pushing many of the issues that already divide them, especially immigration and trade. Clinton's natural home is in the pro-business center, a position that will be advantageous to her and Democrats in the short term at least. But she has to be cautious. Emboldened by Sanders and by Elizabeth Warren, the progressive wing of the Democrats is growing, and will be unhappy with Clinton's pro-business instincts.\n\nThe internal fights will continue in both parties. The competing wings of both parties will feel that they are the true Republicans/Democrats. The growing importance of outside, non-party groups in elections will also force ideological diversity onto the parties. Party leaders might instinctually want to wrest power back from these outside groups, but they'd be wiser to open up their tent to allow for different ideas. After all, the party that does best in American politics is always the one that can build the broadest coalition, which means accepting ideological diversity.\n\nEventually, congressional leaders will realize (or be forced to realize) that the only leadership style that works is a less centralized, more committee-driven approach. This is the only way ideologically heterogeneous parties can effectively govern. A more decentralized Congress, with more fluid coalitions, will function better, assuming that a more committee-driven process is also accompanied by increases in congressional staffing capacity. Partisan control of Congress will mean less, since there will be more cross-party coalitions.\n\nMany issues, like gun rights or affirmative action, will remain very partisan. But other issues, especially those of corporate/Wall Street power, antitrust, interventionist foreign policy, will likely split the parties. Trump Republicans and Sanders Democrats will find common cause against establishment centrists. Big organized interests, like the Chamber of Commerce and other corporate groups, will align less closely with Republicans, realizing that their future success will require the right mix of Republicans and Democrats to advance their agendas.\n\nAnd as the parties become more ideological diverse, voters, who are generally more ideologically all over the place than the current party alignment would suggest, will identify less reliably with one or the other, since there will be more for them in both parties. They will again sometimes split their tickets, depending on who is running. Many will feel more passionate about individual issues and will align themselves with supporters of those issues in both parties, especially as individual interest groups become cross-partisan in order to achieve policy outcomes. In that respect, politics will come to look more like it did in the 1950s and 1970s, when liberal Republicans existed alongside conservative Democrats.\n\nThis is an optimistic scenario.\n\nBut it only works if party leaders tolerate diversity within their party and allow disagreements.\n\nAnother scenario is that establishment Republicans banish the Trump faction and Democrats banish the Sanders faction after the 2016 elections, and both parties go back to the predictable and intractable trench warfare battle lines that have become increasingly dug in over the past two decades, using nastier and nastier tactics to subvert internal divisions in service of the larger fight against a common enemy. This may be possible for a little while longer (especially if the economy improves significantly), but it is still probably long-term unsustainable for reasons I've described above. It also may mean that 2020 becomes an even more violent and nasty election.\n\nAnother possibility is that the parties realign quickly, with the Trump/Tea Party faction effecting a rapid transformation of the Republican Party into a downscale nationalist populist party, pushing the remaining upper-class moderate Republicans into a more pro-business Democratic Party, which in turn pushes some disaffected Sanders voters into the Republican Party. If this realignment happens too quickly, there is no period of depolarization. But this seems unlikely, given the stickiness of partisan identity and the strong disagreements between the two parties on a whole range of other issues.\n\nOther scenarios are possible as well, especially if there are significant global crises.\n\nBut here's the bottom line: Something is different this year in American politics. The logic that has operated for the past two decades or so is breaking down, largely because the factors and trends that propelled it produced unsustainable contradictions. American politics is now entering a new logic, with new trends and forces that will push the lines of political conflict in directions we are only beginning to understand.\n\nThis feels like chaos, and it is. But it is also good news, because chaos scrambles the rules. We've hit peak polarization. Politics is slowly coming unstuck. A period of new possibilities awaits.\n\nThis post is part of Polyarchy, an independent blog produced by the political reform program at New America, a Washington think tank devoted to developing new ideas and new voices.

And indeed, as if on cue, two gunmen with apparent ties to Islamic militants overseas tried to storm the heavily secured event in a similar fashion, before being shot dead by a local police officer Sunday night.\n\nThe incident comes at a time when tensions between some segments of American society and Muslims appear to be becoming more fraught \u2013 with protests against Muslims in Texas and anti-Muslim social-media attacks after the release of the film \"American Sniper.\" In that context, Geller's actions raise questions about speech seen by many as motivated to incite anger and hatred.\n\nIt is an issue Geller has faced before.\u00a0Two weeks ago, she won a federal free-speech case against New York\u2019s Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which had refused to put up one of her ads: \u201cKilling Jews is Worship that draws us close to Allah\u201d \u2013 a quote\u00a0the ad attributes to \u201cHamas MTV.\u201d\n\nGeller\u2019s organization has often clashed with officials in other cities, including Philadelphia and Washington, over their incendiary ads, some of which compare Islam to Nazism. In 2012, another federal judge ruled that cities could not refuse to post her subway poster that read: \u201cIn any war between the civilized man and the savage, support the civilized man. Support Israel. Defeat Jihad.\u201d\n\nMany supporters of Geller and her organization view the violence on Sunday as a vindication of their views of Islam as an inherently violence-prone religion. But for others, her relentless campaign to push the boundaries of free speech with intentionally incendiary messages is only poisoning public discourse at a particularly volatile time.\n\n\u201cAnd coming as it did right when we, the United States of America, are really facing a time when we have to question what it is that holds us together, I can see this potentially aggravating the already-challenging times for dealing with some of these questions about cultural difference, diversity, and what kind of society we want to be,\u201d says Gordon Coonfield, director of graduate studies in communication at Villanova University near Philadelphia.\n\nAfter analyzing some of the submissions to the American Freedom Defense Initiative\u2019s \u201cMuhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest,\u201d Professor Coonfield pointed out the similarities of some of the depictions of the prophet Muhammad to posters for \u201cDer Ewige Jude,\u201d or \u201cThe Eternal Jew,\u201d a notorious Nazi propaganda \u201cdocumentary.\u201d\n\nIn one of the cartoons, the prophet is depicted as contorted and snarling and as a hook-nosed man in a turban holding a bloody knife. The caption reads, \u201cWhen it comes to religion ... I\u2019ve got the edge.\u201d The face, Coonfield notes, is nearly identical to the contorted face of \u201cThe Eternal Jew\u201d poster.\n\n\u201cThat strategy for creating a sense of \u2018unity\u2019 by lifting up this internal enemy is as old as human civilization and culture,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s ironic that the kind of thinking that Hitler used, and the Nazis have become famous for using \u2013 propaganda to try to create this sense of a collective by creating a strong unquestionably evil Other who is right here in our midst ... so it\u2019s kind of ironic that she\u2019s trying to link some of these things together, when that is in fact her message.\u201d\n\nDespite the fact that images depicting the prophet Muhammad cut deeply to the heart of Muslim identity, Muslim leaders in Texas told their followers not to picket or protest the event on Sunday.\n\n\u201cHer words are not just free speech,\u201d says Linda Sarsour, executive director of the Arab American Association of New York. \u201cThey are inciteful; they incite hate against our whole community. I was very dismayed by the shooting in Garland, Texas, but at the same time, Pamela Geller is not the victim in this situation that we\u2019re in right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe intentionally put that event together in hopes that she\u2019d get the response that she received,\u201d Ms. Sarsour says.\n\n\u201cWe prayed, but not one Muslim from the state of Texas went out to protest her,\u201d she added. \u201cMuslim leaders specifically told people, do not go anywhere near her. Let her do whatever she does. We don\u2019t care. And there was no protesting outside \u2013 unfortunately, except for these two guys from Arizona, who were already on the radar of the FBI anyway.\u201d\n\nAdvocates have tried to counter Geller\u2019s free political expressions with ad campaigns of a different tone. In 2012, a coalition called Rabbis for Human Rights responded to her \u201csupport the civilized man\u201d poster with an opposing message that read, \u201cIn the choice between love and hate, choose love. Help stop bigotry against our Muslim neighbors.\u201d\n\nAnd last week, the makers of the satirical film \u201cThe Muslims Are Coming!\u201d launched a humorous series of subway and bus ads to counter Geller's. \u201cThe Muslims are coming, and they shall strike with hugs so fierce, you\u2019ll end up calling your grandmother and telling her that you love her.\u201d\n\nBut in an era in which the Islamic State, the Tsarnaev trial, and the lingering aftermath of 9/11 still inflame fears about Islam, many worry that Sunday\u2019s violence will exacerbate the current tensions.\n\n\u201cFree speech is about being open to listening to the ideas you hate the most, that you disagree with the most, and I feel this group in particular is hiding behind this free speech rhetoric,\u201d Coonfield says. \u201cThis can\u2019t become the poster child for Christianity versus Islam or the West versus the Middle East. We have to maintain a space where groups that have very different ways of thinking and viewing the world can still come together to talk about it, without resorting to this kind of craziness.\u201d", "52": "Drug and substance abuse has ruined and taken the lives of many.

Instead, it\u2019s just an update on the gold and silver markets which, while refusing to go further down, aren\u2019t making much progress to the upside, either. From Craig Hemke, TFMetalsReport : Today\u2019s message: A few more slightly positive US economic datapoints and these are likely enough to make a December FF rate hike a fait accompli. Again, though\u2026and I can\u2019t stress this enough\u2026 we have traced out a pattern that is remarkably similar to last October and November in the run up to the most recent FF rate hike. And what happened beginning the very next day? Well, by now you know the story. The week of the October 2o15 FOMC produced a high trade in the Dec15 contract of $1183. As the Fedlines were digested later that week, it became clear that the Fed was going to raise the FF rate at the December 2015 meeting come hell or high water. And they did. However, take a close look at how gold traded in the days and weeks between the Oct15 FOMC and the December rate hike. Price fell from $1180 to $1050 in about five weeks but note that it bottomed well in advance of the actual \u201cnews\u201d of the FF rate hike. This 10+% drop was fueled by a near panic level liquidation of the Specs at the Comex. How bad was it? From the CoT survey of 10/27/15, just one day before that fateful FOMC and Fedlines, the Large Specs in gold were NET long more than 157,000 contracts while the Commercials were NET short nearly 166,000. Just five weeks later, the NET position of the Large Specs was down to only 10,000 contracts with the Commercial position reaching an alltime low of just 2,911 contracts NET short. We even speculated at the time that there were some days, intraweek, where the Gold Commercials were actually and historically NET LONG. Well now compare last autumn to our current situation. Just as back then, a FF rate hike is a near certainty at the FOMC in December. However, as you know, the anticipatory move in gold began a few weeks ago with the beatdown and purposeful break of both the 50-day and 100-day moving averages in late September. Take a look at the current chart and compare it to the one posted above: In 2015, we had the October FOMC and then two stout down weeks. Before price turned, we slogged through 5-6 weeks of consolidation and CoT improvement before the blast higher began. In 2016, we had the September FOMC and then two stout down weeks. Price is attempting to bottom and turn while the CoT improves, but it doesn\u2019t seem ready just yet to begin moving consistently higher. In 2015, the turn in gold began once the actual rate hike took place. The rate hike and forecast for 3 or 4 more in 2016 led to dollar strength, which led to Chinese devaluations, which led to emerging market crises, which led to equity selloffs and the gold price was already 5-10% off its lows by late January before the real fun began with the USDJPY falling 10% in early February. Are we headed down that same path again? It certainly appears so as the first major salvos of Chinese yuan devaluation were fired last week: http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-10-20/dear-janet-china-devalues-most-august-yuan-tumbles-lowest-sept-2010 And, just as in 2015, the CoT is certainly undergoing a makeover, too. From the survey of 9/27/16, the Large Specs in gold were NET long 292,000 contracts while the Commercials were NET short 325,000. As of last Tuesday and just three weeks later, the Large Specs were down to 180,000 NET long for a reduction of 38% and the Commercials were NET short 203,000. To be sure, these are still hefty positions but much more \u201cbullish\u201d than the levels seen through the past summer. And now check the full long-term chart. You can see again the similarities between now and last fall. Also be sure to note, however, that the trend has clearly changed and that price is pointed higher. So while we must still deal with the consolidation for a while longer\u2026the Ying and Yang mentioned in the title of this post\u2026it is clear to me that the trend remains higher and that the now-expected FOMC FF rate hike will be simply another \u201csell-the-rumor, buy-the-news\u201d type of event for gold and silver. This current period of relative quiet should be used to prepare for the next leg UP, not some sort of new bear market where paper prices are sharply falling. Use your time wisely and continue to prepare/stack accordingly.

But with more Americans opting out of parties, is the process representative of what America wants? The New York primary \u2013 and others ahead \u2013 offer insights.\n\nHow SNL's 'the bubble' sketch about polarization is all too true\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders speaks to supporter Michael Cantalupo while taking a walk in New York's Times Square Tuesday. Mr. Cantalupo said he is unable to vote in the New York primaries\n\nDenise Guardascione, a waitress for nearly three decades at the Shalimar Diner in Queens, thinks the New York primary process was rigged.\n\nShe\u2019s a vocal supporter of Republican front-runner Donald Trump, but as a registered Democrat, Ms. Guardascione missed the deadline to switch her registration to become a Republican \u2013 which, shocking to her, was more than six months ago.\n\nAnd now, the independent-minded waitress has become bewildered by what seems to be the complicated, back-room system of electing party delegates both in her own state and across the country.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s antiquated, it belongs in the Smithsonian, next to Archie Bunker\u2019s chair!\u201d says Ms. Guardascione, a Queens native who works six days a week slinging eggs and coffee for this well-known political haunt. \u201cIt\u2019s just for the [expletive] bigwigs and muckety mucks, not us, not the people who just want to vote.\u201d\n\nIn truth, presidential primaries have never been more open. Since 1972, primaries have gone from being the province of party bosses to vibrant voter-driven contests. But in this year of populist revolt in both parties, \u201cmore open\u201d looks to many voters like \u201cstill pretty antiquated.\u201d\n\nThat is by design. Parties, after all, are not democratic. They can choose their nominees in whichever way they think is best. But at a time when Democrats and Republicans are a shrinking share of the population, closed primaries are shutting more and more of America out.\n\nThe irony is that America is no less partisan. Research suggests the growing ranks of independents are just as partisan as the parties. These voters have just abandoned parties because they are ashamed by how the parties act.\n\nThe anger over closed primaries, superdelegates, and convention arcana isn\u2019t likely to help. (Nor are allegations of irregularities in the New York primary. On Thursday, the state's Elections Board suspended the top official in charge of Brooklyn after numerous allegations, the most serious of which is that 125,000 Democratic voters were incorrectly purged from the rolls before polls opened.)\n\nThe question is, whether the spotlight of this election could force further change ahead, both in states and in the nation.\n\n\u201cNew York and other states have long given power to the parties and to the establishment,\u201d says Jeanne Zaino, a political scientist at Iona College in New Rochelle, N.Y. \u201cBut who has higher voting turnout? States that have early voting, states that have mail in ballots and same day registration. We in New York allow none of that. This was not just a closed primary, this was an ultra-closed primary. Whether you\u2019re running for office or voting, you had to be on top of your game to be a part of it.\u201d\n\nThe knock against closed primaries in this election season has been that they hurt insurgent candidates like Trump and Bernie Sanders. But the picture isn\u2019t so simple.\n\nYes, Senator Sanders of Vermont has done much better among independents. But his biggest wins \u2013 in Hawaii, Alaska, and Washington state \u2013 all came in closed primaries or caucuses.\n\nTrump, meanwhile, has in many cases actually done better among Republicans than independents.\n\nWhat is clear is that the primary rules disenfranchise those who most dislike the parties. \u201cSo why is Sanders doing so well among independents?\u201d asks Dan Hopkins of the FiveThirtyEight data journalism website. \u201cIt appears to be driven not by their ideology so much as their dislike of partisan politics.\u201d\n\nIn one respect, that makes sense. Why would parties give vote to someone who doesn\u2019t like them?\n\nYet those people are a growing share of the American electorate. Some 39 percent Americans now identify as independents; 32 percent say they\u2019re Democrats, and 23 percent say they\u2019re Republicans, according to a Pew Research Center survey last year.\n\nIn 2000, 29 percent were independents, 33 percent were Democrats, and 28 percent were Republicans, Pew found\n\nIn Tuesday\u2019s closed primary, \u201cthree million people in the state of New York who are independents have lost their right to vote in the Democratic or Republican primary,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nIt almost certainly hurt Sanders. In Michigan, for example, Hillary Clinton won the Democratic vote by 58 to 40 percent \u2013 similar to the 58 to 42 percent margin in New York. But since Michigan was an open primary where independents could vote, Sanders won the state by taking 71 percent of independent voters.\n\nEight of the 16 remaining primary contests \u2013 including Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Maryland \u2013 are closed contests.\n\nSanders and his supporters have also complained about the fact that 15 percent of the delegates to the Democratic National Convention \u2013 712 out of 4,763 \u2013 are party leaders known as \u201csuperdelegates,\u201d who overwhelmingly support Mrs. Clinton.\n\nIn short, the deck is stacked against Sanders. And intentionally so.\n\nSanders isn\u2019t a Democrat; he\u2019s an independent who describes himself as a democratic socialist. It is not illogical that Democratic primaries should favor an actual Democrat.\n\nThe same is true, in different ways, for Trump. The GOP front-runner won a solid victory in New York. But he's getting little help from the establishment in navigating the complex delegate rules \u2013 rules that he says are rigged. Meanwhile, the well-organized campaign of Sen. Ted Cruz outmaneuvered him in Louisiana and swept Colorado\u2019s state convention contest.\n\nPresidents have always gone through a complex, multilayered processes in which voters, local officials, and party leaders each have their role, scholars say. Party leaders should have no small say in choosing their party\u2019s presidential nominee, the thinking goes.\n\nBut even within the parties, there is some restlessness for change. \u201cClosed primaries poison the health of that system and warp its natural balance,\u201d said Charles Schumer (D) of New York, now the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate, to The New York Times in 2014.\n\nAs America\u2019s political balance increasingly settles outside either of the two parties, 2016 is showing how even a more open system can be warped.\n\n\u201cAnd if part of that story is about disenfranchisement, it is about these younger voters, people who are new to the process, or who disengaged from it and didn\u2019t register, or registered as independent and couldn\u2019t vote,\u201d says Professor Zaino.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re talking about Sanders supporters who are going to be on the losing end of that.\u201d", "58": "It should be evident if you\u2019re following news concerning the Standing Rock protests in North Dakota that tension continues to escalate between protestors supporting the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and...

Fred Buzhardt, a lawyer defending President Richard Nixon in the Watergate case, revealed that a key White House tape had an 18...", "62": "Buried beneath Wednesday's eye-popping headlines about Hillary Clinton's sinking favorability ratings, you'll find the reason that she's still on course to win the Democratic primary.\n\nFirst, the headline number: A new Washington Post/ABC News poll shows that 53 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Clinton, an 8 percentage point increase since July. Her favorable rating has declined by 7 percentage points to 45 percent over the same period of time, and the split among registered voters is even worse for her, at 56 percent unfavorable to 43 percent favorable. A majority of women (51 percent) now view her unfavorably. None of that is good news for Clinton.\n\nShe's been on a pretty steady drop from the moment she left the State Department in early 2013. That was a foreseeable outcome of Clinton moving back into domestic partisan politics after four years of representing America's interests abroad. Ellen Tauscher, a former member of Congress and undersecretary of state, warned Clinton that would happen in a private conversation about Clinton's political future in September 2011, when about two-thirds of Americans rated her favorably.\n\nBut what's apparent \u2014 and of more immediate interest to Clinton \u2014 is that she's still better regarded among Democrats than Vice President Joe Biden, who is still weighing whether to run against her. Biden's dead-even 46 percent to 46 percent favorable/unfavorable rating is better than Clinton's, but the edge is based on him having higher numbers with Republicans and independents, the vast majority of whom won't vote in the Democratic primaries.\n\nA full 80 percent of Democrats view Clinton favorably, compared with 70 percent who feel that way about Biden. Her number among African Americans is 79 percent, and it's 68 percent among Hispanics. By comparison, Biden is viewed favorably by just 67 percent of African Americans and 49 percent of Hispanics.\n\nThat helps explain why Clinton is blowing her Democratic competition out of the water in national horse-race polls. She was up 35 percentage points in a head-to-head matchup with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in a PPP poll conducted August 28 to 30 and held a 45-22-18 lead over Sanders and Biden in a Quinnipiac survey conducted from August 20 to 25.\n\nShe's also doing much better on the favorability scale than either Republican frontrunner Donald Trump or former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Trump checked in with a favorable number that has risen to 37 percent, about the same as Bush's 38 percent. Trump had an unfavorable score of 59 percent, while Bush was at 55 percent.\n\nThe Clinton ship has taken on water. But, along with other recent surveys, this poll tell us that Clinton is still running away with her party's nomination and remains in better position than any of her Republican or Democratic rivals to advance to the all-important second round of the presidential race. For someone who lost the 2008 primary in part because she looked ahead to the general election, it makes sense to focus on winning the primary first in 2016. On that score, she's still in great shape.", "63": "New Wikileaks email dumps have revealed massive corruption surrounding Hillary Clinton campaign chair John Podesta .

When the State Department responded to the Judicial Watch FOIA request by telling Judicial Watch that it had no emails from Clinton, Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit. When the State Department made the same representation to the court -- as incredible as it seemed at the time -- the judge accepted that representation, and the case was dismissed.\n\nThen The New York Times revealed that Clinton used a private email server instead of the government\u2019s server for all of her work-related and personal emails during her four years as secretary of state. After that, the Judicial Watch FOIA case was reinstated, and then the judge in the case demanded of State that it produce Clinton\u2019s emails.\n\nWhen Judicial Watch expressed frustration to the judge about the pace at which it was getting emails, the judge ordered Clinton, \u201cunder penalty of perjury,\u201d to certify that she had surrendered all her governmental emails to the State Department.\n\nEventually, Clinton did certify to the court that she did surrender all of her governmental emails to the State Department. She did so by sending paper copies of selected emails, because she had wiped clean her server. She acknowledged that she decided which emails were personal and which were selected as governmental and returned the governmental ones to the State Department. She has denied steadfastly and consistently that she ever sent or received any materials marked \"classified\u201d while secretary of state using her private server.\n\nAll of her behavior has triggered the FBI investigation because she may have committed serious federal crimes. For example, it is a crime to steal federal property. What did she steal? By diverting to her own venue the digital metadata that accompany all emails -- metadata that, when attached to the work-related emails of a government employee, belong to the government -- she stole that data. The metadata do not appear on her paper copies -- hence the argument that she stole and destroyed the government-owned metadata.\n\nThis is particularly troublesome for her present political ambitions because of a federal statute that disqualifies from public office all who have stolen federal property. (She is probably already barred from public office -- though this was not prominently raised when she entered the U.S. Senate or the Department of State -- because of the china, silverware and furniture that she and her husband took from the White House in January 2001.)\n\nClinton may also have committed espionage by failing to secure the government secrets entrusted to her. She did that by diverting those secrets to an unprotected, nongovernmental venue -- her own server -- and again by emailing those secrets to other unprotected and nongovernmental venues. The reason she can deny sending or receiving anything marked \"classified\u201d is that protected government secrets are not marked \u201cclassified.\u201d\n\nSo her statement, though technically true, is highly misleading. The governmental designations of protected secrets are \u201cconfidential,\u201d \u201csecret\u201d and \u201ctop secret\u201d -- not \u201cclassified.\u201d State Department investigators have found 999 emails sent or received by Clinton in at least one of those three categories of protected secrets.\n\nBack when Clinton became secretary of state, on her first day in office, she had an hourlong FBI briefing on the proper and lawfully required care of government secrets. She signed a statement, under penalty of perjury, acknowledging that she knew the law and that it is the content of emails, not any stamped markings, that makes them secret.\n\nEarlier this week, my Fox News colleagues confirmed the certain presence of top-secret materials among the 999 emails. Intelligence from foreign sources or about foreign governments is always top-secret, whether designated as such or not. And she knows that.\n\nAs well, she may have committed perjury in the FOIA case. When the House Select Committee on Benghazi, in its investigation of her role in the deaths of the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, gathered emails, it found emails she did not surrender to the State Department.\n\nLast week, the State Department released emails that give the FBI more areas to investigate. These emails may show a pattern of official behavior by Clinton designed to benefit the financial interests of her family's foundation, her husband and her son-in-law. Moreover, the FBI knows of a treasure-trove of documents that may demonstrate that the Clinton Foundation skirted the law and illegally raised and spent contributions.\n\nTwo months ago, a group of FBI agents sat around a conference table and reviewed the evidence gathered thus far. Each agent was given the opportunity to make or detract from the case for moving forward. At the end of the meeting, it was the consensus of the group to pursue a criminal investigation.\n\nAnd Clinton is the likely target.\n\nAndrew P. Napolitano, a former judge of the Superior Court of New Jersey, is the senior judicial analyst at Fox News Channel.", "65": "It was not supposed to end like this for Marco Rubio.\n\nEleven months ago, he launched his presidential campaign in front of Miami\u2019s Freedom Tower, the Ellis Island for his and other Cuban families. In his rapid rise, young Rubio had been a darling of both the tea party movement and the conservative intelligentsia \u2014 the Republicans\u2019 best hope of attracting nonwhite voters.\n\nBut then came vulgar Donald Trump. Rubio was savaged on everything from immigration to his height. On Tuesday night, Rubio, his campaign fading, lost his home state of Florida to the bigoted demagogue who makes scapegoats of foreigners and minorities. Bowing to the inevitable, Rubio ended his candidacy.\n\nBy the time Rubio\u2019s campaign bus rolled to its final pre-primary stop \u2014 an outdoor basketball court here where he played as a boy \u2014 only a couple-hundred supporters were on hand, nearly equaled by the number of journalists on death watch.\n\nBefore Rubio arrived, a prankster hijacked the microphone and was chased off by campaign aides. When Rubio himself spoke, the sound system failed, so he delivered his valedictory with a bullhorn.\n\n[The GOP establishment has failed. It\u2019s up to voters to deny Trump.]\n\nRubio\u2019s voice sounded tinny, but his words were rich with nostalgia as he recalled knocking on doors when he ran for city commissioner here. \u201cIn between sips of sweet Cuban coffee, I heard the stories of their youth, of the dreams they lost,\u201d he said. \u201cThat has carried me every single day throughout this campaign, knowing that my worst days are better than some of the best days that many people in this community have had.\u201d\n\nThese are not the best days for Rubio, or for anybody who cares about American democracy. The 44-year-old made mistakes during his campaign: freezing in the New Hampshire debate, failing to take on Trump earlier, then finally attacking Trump by joking about genitalia.\n\nYet he finished honorably. He spoke reflectively Monday about Trump\u2019s brutal transformation of politics. This message should have been delivered much earlier, but it deserves to be heard even now.\n\n\u201cLeadership is not about going to an angry and frustrated people and saying you should be even angrier and more frustrated, and you should be angry and frustrated at each other,\u201d Rubio told a gym full of Christian college students in West Palm Beach. \u201cThat\u2019s called demagoguery. And it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d It leads, he said, to \u201cwhere we are today, a nation where people literally hate each other because they\u2019re voting for different candidates. .\u2009.\u2009. And it leaves us incapable of solving problems.\u201d\n\nTrump tore up the norms of decency that remained in American politics, and Rubio expressed puzzlement that it worked. \u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve been told being humble is a virtue, and now being humble is a weakness and being vain and self-absorbed is somehow a virtue,\u201d he said. \u201cMy whole life I\u2019ve been told no matter how you feel about someone, you respect everyone because we are all children of the same God \u2014 and now being respectful to one another is considered political correctness.\u201d\n\nRubio voiced regret for his own role in the vulgarity, saying he \u201cfelt terrible\u201d for joking about Trump\u2019s penis size. Such remorse separates Rubio from Trump, who seems to have no shame as he blurts obscenities, delivers insults and winks at violence. \u201cThere are people, I know, who like this stuff because he says what they want to be able to say, [but] presidents can\u2019t say whatever they want to say,\u201d Rubio told the students, mentioning the harm to America\u2019s reputation that Trump has already done. \u201cWe\u2019re not a Third World country. We\u2019re the United States of America.\u201d\n\n[Donald Trump just threatened more violence. Only this time, it\u2019s directed at the GOP.]\n\nThat\u2019s the welcoming country to which Rubio\u2019s parents immigrated, settling among the shoe-box homes here in Cuban West Miami. \u201cEverywhere I go I tell the story of this community of people, many of whom lost their country in their youth,\u201d Rubio said Monday night in his boyhood park, his kids beside him in the bed of his Dodge pickup.\n\nHe spoke, in English, then in Spanish, with the requisite optimism, telling supporters he looked forward to moving his \u201ccaja china\u201d \u2014 Cuban barbecue \u2014 to the White House.\n\n\u201cIf there\u2019s no car, we\u2019ll go in a raft!\u201d a supporter said in Spanish.\n\nAnother said in English: \u201cDon\u2019t give up, man!\u201d\n\nBut Rubio\u2019s speech to his modest band had the ring of a farewell. \u201cI will always be a son of this community. I will always carry with me the hopes and dreams of generations that made possible the dreams of mine,\u201d he said. His candidacy, he said, \u201cwas possible because you and I happen to live in the one place on Earth where even the son of a bartender and a maid from West Miami can be president.\u201d\n\nOr at least he can lose to a trash-talking rich guy from Queens.\n\nRead more from Dana Milbank\u2019s archive, follow him on Twitter or subscribe to his updates on Facebook.", "66": "Washington (CNN) Loretta Lynch was sworn in as the new U.S. attorney general on Monday, replacing Eric Holder. Lynch, the country's first African-American woman to serve in the role, had her nomination held up more than five months over politicking in the Senate.\n\n\"Ladies and gentlemen, it's about time,\" said Vice President Joe Biden at the swearing in ceremony.\n\nThe highly politicized five-month battle to choose Obama's next attorney general came to a close Thursday when the Senate finally voted 56-43 to confirm Lynch\n\nBut the delay of her nomination neared record-breaking proportions. Republicans leading the Senate refused to bring her nomination up for a vote until Democrats cut a deal on abortion language in an unrelated bill. That legislation passed Wednesday, setting up Thursday's vote and ending the latest partisan Washington standoff.\n\nTen Republicans, including Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, joined Democrats. Texas GOP Sen. Ted Cruz was the only senator not to vote.\n\nObama tapped Lynch to replace Attorney General Eric Holder in November and her nomination cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee in February. Still, she waited longer than the seven most recent U.S. attorneys general combined for a vote on the Senate floor, after Majority Leader Mitch McConnell insisted on first finishing work on an unrelated bill.\n\nLoretta Lynch's father, Lorenzo A. Lynch, was in the Senate gallery watching when the historic vote took place confirming her daughter as the first African American female attorney general.\n\n\"The good guys won. That's what has happened in this country all along,\" Lorenzo Lynch told reporters. \"Even during slavery. Levi Coffin was a founder of the Underground Railroad. Even during slavery. A white man fought against slavery. So all over this land good folks have stood in the right lane, in the right path.\"\n\nA two-time U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of New York, Lynch takes on the high-profile job at time when America faces a series of challenges, from dealing with strained relations and deep distrust in some cities between the police and the communities they serve, to criminal justice reform, to confronting the ongoing threat of terrorism.\n\nLynch, 55, has earned a reputation as a highly qualified, but low-profile prosecutor who has a good relationship with law enforcement and a history of handling tough cases well.\n\nShe is a good listener and a skilled consensus builder, qualities that will help her succeed at Justice, said Tim Heaphy, a former U.S. attorney for the Western District of Virginia who served under Lynch on the Attorney General's Advisory Committee, a group that meets regularly to advise the Justice department on policy matters.\n\n\"In that [attorney general] job you are at the center of so many of the emerging, significant, pressing issues not only in this country but around the world. There's probably no job in government as diverse and challenging as being attorney general of the United States,\" Heaphy said. He added that building support for initiatives both within and outside the department is an important part of the job.\n\n\"She will be good at getting people to work well together. I think that's a strength of hers. I saw that on the committee,\" Heaphy said.\n\nLynch's portfolio will include addressing voting rights, white-collar crime and policy reviews, as well as public corruption, an area in which she has vast experience.\n\nIn a statement, Obama said America will be better off with Lynch leading the Department of Jusice.\n\n\"Loretta's confirmation ensures that we are better positioned to keep our communities safe, keep our nation secure, and ensure that every American experiences justice under the law,\" Obama said in a statement shortly after the vote.\n\nLynch's experience on civil rights case, like helping win the convictions of New York City police officers who sexually assaulted Haitian immigrant Abner Louima, will be important as her office tackles closely watched investigations in recent police conduct cases, including the still unexplained death of a 25-year-old Baltimore man while in police custody.\n\n\"She's seen and understands the injustices that have taken place in the past and so therefore she's uniquely also equipped to deal with what's going on and do the kinds of investigations that will restore faith to Americans in their justice system,\" said Rep. Greg Meeks, D-New York.\n\nBorn in Greensboro, North Carolina, Lynch grew up 60 miles to the east in Durham, North Carolina. Her father was a fourth-generation Baptist minister; her mother, an English teacher and school librarian. As a child, Lynch rode on her father's shoulders to his church, which served a meeting place for students organizing anti-segregation boycotts in the early 1960s, she told the Judiciary panel at her January confirmation hearing. Lynch eventually graduated from Harvard College and Harvard Law School.\n\nSpeaking at her nomination announcement in November, Lynch highlighted the fact that the Justice Department is named for an ideal.\n\n\"This is actually appropriate, because our work is both aspirational, and grounded in gritty reality,\" she said. \"Today, I stand before you so thrilled, and, frankly, so humbled to have the opportunity to lead this group of wonderful people who work all day and well into the night to make that ideal a manifest reality.\"\n\nAt a conference meeting with all the nation's U.S. attorneys a few years ago, Heaphy was put in charge of organizing a presentation showing the attorneys as they were 20 years before. Lynch shared a picture of herself with her college cheerleading squad.\n\n\"Loretta sent me a picture of her as a Harvard cheerleader in a pyramid,\" he said. \"She was comfortable sharing this with Eric Holder and other department leaders. She laughed at herself.\"\n\n\"I don't think she's just tough, there's a humanity, there's a human touch that she has that will also serve her well,\" he said. \"Nobody is going to mistake that she's in charge, but her humility and sense of humor will come through.\"", "67": "GOP opposes the kind of antitrust regulation that would preserve freedom of expression online.\n\nAmerica\u2019s right wing is in a froth\u00a0about allegations that Facebook has tweaked its \u201ctrending news\u201d feed to reduce the visibility of conservative news sites.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear if the allegations, from a Gizmodo report based on anonymous sources, are true and Facebook denies them. But the deeper problem is undeniably real: Facebook is the dominant member of a small number of giant entities \u2014 corporate and governmental \u2014 that are gaining control over news, freedom of expression\u00a0and much of our digital lives. The irony is that the conservatives and business-backed Republicans in Congress who howl about Facebook are the same people who have thwarted policies that would encourage the competition we need to challenge that increasingly centralized control.\n\nAlmost no one wants to address the fact that Facebook is becoming a monopoly in the antitrust sense of the word. Along with Google, it dominates online advertising; Facebook especially does so on mobile devices, which are the way many people connect to the Internet. If you offer news and information online, you have almost no choice but to play on Facebook\u2019s field\u00a0because so much of your audience is there. (In some parts of the world, Facebook essentially is the Internet, because mobile devices are pretty much the sole means of online access\u00a0and in some cases the company has made deals with local telecommunications companies and,\u00a0or governments.)\n\nFacebook has been buying everything that presents even a whiff of competition: Instagram, WhatsApp, Oculus. This is smart \u2014 no one can dispute that Mark Zuckerberg and the others on his team are brilliant technologists and strategists \u2014 but it\u2019s also a red flag. As Zuckerberg famously said several years ago, he wants Facebook to be \u201clike electricity.\u201d Well, electricity is a utility. And we regulate utilities.\n\nMonopolies and cozy oligopolies never turn out well in the long run for anyone but the monopolists or cartel members. They end up controlling markets and do their best to thwart genuine competition. It\u2019s their nature. Which is why capitalism, plainly the best system when it\u2019s working right, needs rules to promote competition.\n\nYet Republicans, in general, think the government should play little to no role in promoting competition. They consider antitrust inquiry and enforcement to be counterproductive, at best \u2014 except, of course, when a powerful constituent (a corporation, usually) is in danger from predatory behavior.\n\nThat attitude accounts for the GOP\u2019s cheerleading for corporate dominance of Internet access. Republicans, in general, are fine with the idea that one or two companies (say the leading cable provider and another telecom) should control access in most communities, and utterly opposed to a remedy \u2014 what we call network neutrality \u2014 to ensure that people at the edges of networks, not dominant Internet service providers, should decide what information they want and at what priority.\n\nI don\u2019t want the government to tell Facebook what it can publish\u00a0and don\u2019t look forward to much more than posturing from Congress. But I do want the government to start paying extremely close attention to the way the company is becoming a monopoly\u00a0and to what it means for freedom of expression when a single company has so much power over what people say online. I want government to use antitrust and other pro-competition laws to ensure that Facebook doesn\u2019t abuse its dominance in a business sense. I want government(s) to promote open technology and communications, and fierce competition at every level. Kudos to Zuckerberg for making Facebook so appealing to millions of users; that\u2019s an amazing achievement.\u00a0But we can\u2019t allow Facebook to leverage that success to block the emergence of alternatives to its service, or use its market power to influence or alter the content of publications and others trying to communicate with Facebook users.\n\nWe all need to wake up to the potential threat Facebook poses to freedom of expression. Once you are in its enclosed online space, it is the corporation\u2019s terms of service, not the First Amendment, that determines what you can say. If it decides to downplay speech it doesn\u2019t like, Facebook has the right to do so.\n\nSo I\u2019m glad that conservatives are concerned, even if the allegations prove overblown. (Facebook has modified its outright denial to a \u201cwe\u2019re looking into it\u201d stance; stay tuned.)\u00a0I\u2019d be even happier if conservatives realized that government does have a role in promoting genuine competition \u2014 and that we\u2019re in uncharted information-freedom territory under the new control freaks of Silicon Valley.\n\nDan Gillmor teaches digital media literacy at Arizona State University.

She tried to talk him out of it but did not contact law enforcement agencies.\n\nWielding an AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle and a handgun, Mateen opened fire at the Pulse club in Orlando, Florida, early on Sunday in a three-hour shooting rampage and hostage siege that ended when a Swat team smashed its way in and killed him. There were 49 people killed and 53 were injured.\n\nAngus King, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, which received a briefing on the attack, told CNN: \u201cIt appears she [Salman] had some knowledge of what was going on. She definitely is, I guess you would say, a person of interest right now and appears to be cooperating and can provide us with some important information.\u201d\n\nPeter King, chairman of the House homeland security subcommittee on counterintelligence and terrorism, told MSNBC: \u201cIf it\u2019s true that she did know that it was going to happen and she tried to talk him out of it, then it\u2019s possible criminal action (could be taken) against her, and again there might be more involvement by her, so all that has to be investigated.\u201d\n\nThe possibility that Mateen, 29, did not act alone but received support from other individuals or groups is now central to the FBI\u2019s inquiry, King added. \u201cIf there\u2019s anybody else that he was dealing with, anyone else he was talking with, anyone else who may have known about this, this is all where the investigation is going now.\u201d\n\nMedia reports also suggested that Salman was with her husband when he bought ammunition and a holster. She allegedly told the FBI that she once drove him to Pulse, nearly a two-hour drive from their home in Fort Pierce, Florida, because he wanted to scope it out. Mateen is said to have browsed militant Islamist material on the internet for at least two years before the mass shooting.\n\nAs detectives tried to piece together Mateen\u2019s last movements on Saturday night, Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer, who opened a family assistance centre in a stadium on Wednesday, said: \u201cWhat I know concretely is that he was driving around that evening and visited several locations.\u201d\n\nThe FBI director, James Comey, has said the agency is trying to determine whether Mateen had recently visited Disney World, one of the Orlando\u2019s celebrated theme parks, to consider it as a potential target.\n\nDisney, which is donating $1m to an official fund for victims of the shooting, installed metal detectors last December but declined to comment on the Mateen case. A spokesperson said: \u201cUnfortunately we\u2019ve all been living in a world of uncertainty, and we have been increasing our security measures across our properties for some time, adding such visible safeguards as magnetometers, additional canine units, and law enforcement officers on site, as well as less visible systems that employ state-of-the-art security technologies.\u201d\n\nSalman will be key to the ongoing investigation as conflicting narratives emerge, including evidence he had been influenced by militant Islamist ideas and reports he might have struggled with his own sexual identity.\n\nA survivor of the massacre, Patience Carter, suggested on Tuesday that Mateen had an overt political motive. Cowering in a bathroom, she heard him demand that Americans \u201cstop bombing his country\u201d and pledge allegiance to Islamic State, she said.\n\nCarter, 20, who is African American, told reporters at Florida Hospital: \u201cHe even spoke to us directly in the bathroom. He said, \u2018Are there any black people in here?\u2019 I was too afraid to answer but there was an African American male in the stall, where the majority of my body was, who had answered and he said, \u2018Yes, there are about six or seven of us,\u2019 and the gunman responded back to him and said: \u2018You know, I don\u2019t have a problem with black people. This is about my country. You guys suffered enough.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe account chimed with previous FBI statements that Mateen had called the 911 emergency service and made reference to both Isis and the Tsarnaev brothers, who were responsible for the Boston bombings. Investigators have said Mateen was probably self-radicalised and there is no evidence that he received any instruction or aid from outside groups such as Isis.\n\nMateen also called a local 24-hour cable news channel, News 13, the station revealed on its website on Wednesday. Matthew Gentili, who was the producer on duty at the time, recalled that Mateen said: \u201cI\u2019m the shooter. It\u2019s me. I am the shooter ... I did it for Isis. I did it for the Islamic State.\u201d\n\nSoon after the attack, Mateen\u2019s father indicated that his son had strong anti-gay feelings. He recounted an incident when his son became angry when he saw two men kissing in downtown Miami while out with his wife and young son.\n\nSeveral media reports quoted men as saying they had seen Mateen at Pulse many times or that he had contacted them via gay dating apps, such as Grindr and Jack\u2019d. But Pulse denied that he had ever been a patron. \u201cUntrue and totally ridiculous,\u201d spokeswoman Sara Brady said in an email to Reuters.\n\nMateen\u2019s ex-wife, Sitora Yusufiy, told CNN she did not know if he was gay but added: \u201cWell, when we had gotten married, he confessed to me about his past that was recent at that time and that he very much enjoyed going to clubs and the nightlife and there was a lot of pictures of him.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s a side of him or a part of him that he lived but probably didn\u2019t want everybody to know about.\u201d\n\nAsked by the Guardian about rumours his son was gay, Mateen\u2019s father Seddique Mateen said: \u201cIt\u2019s not true. Why, if he was gay, would he do this?\u201d\n\nSeddique Mateen declined to comment specifically on the investigation on Wednesday, saying: \u201cThe FBI, they always do a professional job and to the maximum extent of my ability I will support them.\u201d\n\nMateen, investigated twice by the FBI, was on the government\u2019s terrorist watchlist for 10 months before being taken off. G4S, the security company that employed Mateen, only psychologically evaluated him once, at the start of his nine-year employment with the company and not again after the company was made aware he had been interviewed by the FBI.\n\nThirty-three people remain in hospital, including six in critical condition. On Tuesday, the first of the seriously injured to speak of their trauma was Angel Colon at the Orlando Regional Medical Center. \u201cHe\u2019s shooting everyone that\u2019s already dead on the floor, making sure they\u2019re dead,\u201d he said, speaking from a wheelchair. \u201cI look over, and he shoots the girl next to me. And I\u2019m just there laying down and I\u2019m thinking: \u2018I\u2019m next, I\u2019m dead.\u2019\n\n\n\n\u201cSo I don\u2019t know how, but by the glory of God, he shoots toward my head but it hits my hand, and then he shoots me again and it hits the side of my hip. I had no reaction. I was just prepared to just stay there laying down so he won\u2019t know that I\u2019m alive.\u201d\n\nThe attending trauma surgeon on call that night, Dr Chadwick Smith, said: \u201cIt was singularly the worst day of my career and the best day of my career. And I think you can say that of pretty much every person standing up here.\u201d\n\nThe atrocity continued to reverberate in Washington DC, where Senate Democrats demanded tighter gun controls. Donald Trump, the Republican presumptive nominee, broke ranks with the party by saying he would meet the influential National Rifle Association lobbying group, which has endorsed him, to discuss an idea for restricting gun purchases by people on terrorism watchlists.\n\nBarack Obama, who will visit Orlando on Thursday, launched a blistering assault against Trump over the candidate\u2019s anti-Muslim rhetoric, which the president described as dangerous and contrary to American values.\n\n\u201cWhere does this stop? The Orlando killer, one of the San Bernardino killers, the Fort Hood killer, [they] were all US citizens. Are we going to start treating all Muslim Americans differently? ... Putting them under surveillance?\u201d", "69": "Is google and YouTube in the Hillary\u2019s purse? page: 1 link After I posted my opening post (OP) on \u201cHillary Clinton Wants a Strong Russia.

Bush, took 49 percent of the state\u2019s Hispanic vote in his 2004 presidential re-election, setting a relatively high bar for the handful of Texas-born or -raised Republicans who might be hoping to follow in his footsteps in 2016.\n\nRepublican presidential aspirants with ties to the Lone Star State\u00a0must figure out how to hold the GOP base and attract conservative Hispanics if they want to be successful in Texas, political observers say.\n\nSo how do the party's four most prominent Texas affiliated might-be candidates \u2014 former Gov.\u00a0Rick Perry; Jeb Bush, the son and brother of two former presidents from the state; Texas\u2019 junior U.S. senator,\u00a0Ted Cruz; and\u00a0U.S. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky \u2014 stack up in the early going?\n\nFor Republicans to avoid a repeat of 2012, when presidential nominee Mitt Romney took only 27 percent of the Hispanic vote nationwide, they need to nominate a conservative candidate who can go into Hispanic communities and truly connect with voters, said Hector De Leon, co-chairman of the\u00a0Associated Republicans of Texas, which reaches out to Hispanic voters.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about paying attention,\u201d De Leon said.\n\nHispanics made up\u00a010 percent\u00a0of the national\u00a0electorate in the 2012 presidential election. But in Texas, they make up\u00a0almost one-third\u00a0of eligible voters. And there\u2019s plenty room for improvement when it comes to voter turnout. Only 39 percent of Texas Hispanics eligible to vote cast ballots in 2012.\n\nPolitical observers say candidates would be right to take a page out of George W. Bush\u2019s playbook on Hispanic outreach. He\u00a0solidified his\u00a0winning record\u00a0with Hispanics with help from\u00a0Latino-media guru\u00a0Lionel Sosa,\u00a0who told The Texas Tribune he has been in talks with Jeb Bush about his possible presidential bid.\n\nSosa helped George W. Bush\u2019s campaign craft several television ads that painted him as the candidate who understood Hispanic culture.\u00a0The candidate who can mobilize on-the-fence Hispanic voters who usually do not turn out to vote could win the state.\n\n\u201cI do think the primaries will include a concerted effort by some candidates to speak to that constituency,\u201d said Sylvia Manzano, a senior analyst for the nonpartisan political polling organization Latino Decisions. \u201cIn Texas, that\u2019s 10 million people. That\u2019s a number that cannot be ignored.\u201d\n\nThough it's still early in the game, many political observers say Jeb Bush is best positioned at the moment. He grew up in Midland, spent much of his childhood in Houston and is considered\u00a0friendly\u00a0to the Hispanic community, both personally and politically.\n\n\u201cJeb Bush is not going to come in and play mariachi politics,\u201d Manzano said. \u201cHe knows better than that.\u201d\n\nBut this far out, all is speculation. As the candidates tiptoe toward the starting gate, here's how several political experts handicap the field.\n\nAlready\u00a0holding a political advantage\u00a0because he is fluent in Spanish, the former Florida governor has experience winning over Hispanics in a state where they make up a large part of the population. During his\u00a01998 re-election campaign, Bush won an impressive 61 percent of Florida's Hispanic electorate. It's worth noting, though, that Florida\u2019s mostly Cuban Hispanic population differs from Texas, where a majority of Hispanics have roots in Mexico.\n\nWhat the experts say:\n\nFor Bush, reaching out to Texas Hispanics would be an extended family affair. Aside from benefiting from the\u00a0groundwork\u00a0his family has done in the state, expect to see Bush campaigning with his Mexican-born wife, Columba, and his son, Texas Land CommissionerGeorge P. Bush, at his side. George P.\u00a0is also fluent in Spanish and helped found Hispanic Republicans of Texas, a political group that recruits and supports Hispanic Republicans running for public office.\n\nBush\u2019s record on issues that resonate with Texas Hispanics, particularly immigration reform, could prove attractive to this voting group. He has urged Congress to pass immigration reform and has highlighted it as a\u00a0key issue\u00a0in helping Republicans win Hispanics. He also gained national attention last year when he said many of those entering the country illegally do so out of an \u201cact of love\u201d for their families.\n\nAs the state\u2019s longest-serving governor, Perry has long courted Texas Hispanics. He has steadily improved his standing since winning only 13 percent of the Hispanic vote when he defeated Hispanic businessman Tony Sanchez of Laredo in 2002. By the time he was re-elected in 2010, Perry pulled in 38 percent of Hispanic voters.\n\nWhat the experts say:\n\nPerry\u2019s efforts to broaden his appeal were buoyed by the passage of the Texas Dream Act during his 14-year tenure. Though the future of the law granting in-state tuition to some undocumented immigrants is\u00a0unclear, Perry has stood by it both on the national stage and at home. During a 2011 presidential debate, Perry famously told opponents who challenged his support of the law that they had no heart. More recently, as the state\u2019s new GOP leadership works to overturn the law, Perry has been vocal about his\u00a0continued support\u00a0for it.\n\nBecause he\u00a0presided over\u00a0the state\u2019s economic boom in the last decade, Perry has a unique opportunity to appeal to Hispanics on economic issues. If Perry can convince Hispanic voters that they benefited from the so-called Texas Miracle, he may be able to sway some on-the-fence voters his way.\n\nThough he is the only Hispanic in the group \u2014 and the first Hispanic senator from Texas \u2014 Cruz has largely avoided making heritage part of his political persona beyond recounting his father\u2019s journey to the United States from Cuban as an exile in 1957. Still, he has done well with Texas Hispanics. In 2012, he outperformed Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, taking 35 percent of the Hispanic vote, according to a Latino Decisions\u00a0poll.\n\nWhat the experts say:\n\nCruz arguably faces the toughest challenge courting Texas Hispanics given his divisive tone on immigration and health care. He has been vocal in his opposition to President Obama\u2019s executive order on immigration, which will grant millions of undocumented immigrants work permits and reprieve from deportation proceedings. The order is widely popular among Hispanics. On health care, Cruz has been one of the biggest foes of the federal Affordable Care Act. Texas Hispanics \u2014 who make up a large portion of the state\u2019s uninsured population \u2014overwhelmingly support\u00a0the health law.\n\nThough Paul was elected to the Senate from Kentucky, where Hispanics make up only 3 percent of the population, he grew up in Lake Jackson, Texas, where Hispanics are one-fifth of the population. Paul has spent the last few months preaching a\u00a0message of Hispanic inclusion\u00a0within the Republican ranks.\n\nWhat the experts say:\n\nPaul is someone to watch in the upcoming election when it comes to appealing to Texas Hispanics because of his views on growing the GOP\u2019s number of Hispanic supporters. Because he is largely unknown among Texas Hispanics, Paul also has some room to improve his standing. A November 2014 poll by Latino Decisions found that almost a third of Texas Latino voters have no opinion of Paul.", "71": "Radio Aryan October 28, 2016 \nSven Longshanks , Dennis Wise and Messerschmitt bring us another episode of Truth Will Out Radio, this week looking at the Laconia incident and the British Freikorps. \nMesserschmitt deviates somewhat with his Axis War Heroes series in that the main subject is not a person but the so-called \u201cLaconia Incident\u201d. In September 1942 a German U-boat under the Command of Werner Hartenstein torpedoed the British troopship Laconia. As Hartenstein realized that a lot of Italian prisoners of war and even civilians including women and children were among the survivors struggling for their lives he ordered that as many as possible were to be taken on board the U-boat. Even though he radioed his intentions to all surrounding vessels in plain English and had a Red Cross flag draped across the U-boat he and the survivors they were carrying were attacked by an American B-24. What happened to the survivors and what the response of the German Navy was when it learned of this atrocity is elaborated on by Schmitt and the presentation ends with a letter from a relative of one of the casualties, thanking the U-boat commanders for their courageous and honourable behaviour. \nThis presentation shows how the Allies were breaking the rules of war while the Germans were keeping to their treaties. During the Nuremberg trials this incident was brought up in the hopes of convicting Admiral Doenitz for advising the U-boats not to pick up survivors, but it had the inadvertent effect of exposing the British and Americans of waging unrestricted submarine warfare, in itself a possible war crime as it breaks the law of the sea that any shipwrecked mariners must be rescued, no matter who they are. Dennis points out the hypocrisy of the British and Americans in this before reminding us that not all the British behaved like this during the war. Some became members of the Freikorps and fought to defend Europe from the Bolshevik menace alongside the other SS Volunteer Legions. These heroes were called traitors by the British establishment, yet their oath was to protect Europe from Communism, not to fight against Britain. It is a testament to the truthful ideology of National Socialism that prisoners of war could be set free to fight against Communism once they had heard the truth about it from their kinsmen in the League of St George. \nAfter giving us a brief history of these brave young British men, Dennis and Sven conclude the podcast by talking about the importance of race and how the Freikorps highlighted this in their propaganda. \nPresented by Sven Longshanks, Dennis Wise and Messerschmitt \nTruth Will Out Radio: The Laconia Incident \u00e2\u0080\u0093 TWOR 102816", "72": "Watch the CNN Republican debate Tuesday, December 15 at 6:00 p.m. ET and 8:30 p.m. ET.\n\nThe GOP establishment, confronted by a recalcitrant electorate that refuses to leave Donald Trump, is being forced to take a fresh look at Ted Cruz , a man with grassroots strength in key early primary states and few friends in Washington.\n\nSuddenly, the Republican Party's best hope could be a man hell-bent on transforming it: a senator who openly spars with fellow GOP colleagues, and has campaigned by painting its leaders as spineless and feeble.\n\nHeaded into Tuesday's CNN Republican presidential debate, Cruz and Trump have turned Iowa into a two-man race, with the Texan leading in two new polls. Cruz is up 31% to Trump's 21% among likely GOP caucus-goers, according to the Bloomberg Politics-Des Moines Register poll released Saturday. A Fox News poll Sunday has Cruz leading Trump 28% to 26%.\n\nA small and growing number of Republicans allied with the establishment -- the force long thought to quickly consolidate against a surging Cruz bid -- are coming to terms with the idea that he may be palatable in an election cycle where Trump has pushed the envelope well beyond what they considered acceptable.\n\n\"Oh God, yes,\" said Ed Rogers, a top Republican lobbyist, when asked if he'd prefer Cruz. \"Compared to Trump, he's OK.\"\n\nEstablishment Republicans had enough of a problem when Trump began his populist-fueled move to the top of national polls, where he has stubbornly remained for five months. But Cruz's steady rise means that even if Trump were taken out by a well-financed negative campaign, they might have to deal with a stronger Cruz, who has more political polish than the more improvisational Trump.\n\n\"If you talk to my peers around town, collectively it's an appreciation the guy is smart as hell,\" explained a senior Washington Republican who is backing another candidate. \"He can be a more acceptable alternative to Trump, if it comes to that.\"\n\nThe irony hasn't escaped them. Said the Republican: \"It's an interesting life -- and everything's relative.\"\n\n\"The second he starts to look like a winner in Washington,\" Rogers said, \"he's going to have a bunch of new friends.\"\n\nIt's a dilemma swatted away on Capitol Hill -- perhaps optimistically.\n\nAsked about choosing Trump or Cruz, 2008 nominee Sen. John McCain would only allow that they are \"smart people.\" Bush backer Sen. Susan Collins would just offer that they are \"obviously not my choice.\"\n\nAnd there's no guarantee either one can beat Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"He's not as outrageous as Trump, but I don't know that he's any more electable than Trump,\" said Charlie Black, a senior adviser to Republican presidential campaigns for over two decades.\n\nBrian Walsh, a longtime Senate campaign aide, said it's an out-of-control Trump -- not an in-control Cruz -- that explains the Texan's growing appeal.\n\n\"Trump has gone so far that it has in some ways masked how problematic Cruz would be as the nominee as well,\" he said.\n\nDespite his background as an Ivy League-educated attorney and his time in the Bush administration, Cruz rose to prominence as a tea party darling who became the national face of the 2013 government shutdown. Cruz has spent the two years since working to salvage his relationship with some potential investors in his campaign, but he has reveled in his image as a Washington bad boy, the only senator willing to do on Capitol Hill what he campaigned on back at home.\n\nIt's something that has made him enemies in Washington, where he has not convinced a single Senate colleague to back his campaign. Cruz helped push Republicans to shut down the government in a high-stakes fight over Obamacare, a strategy that failed to get results but didn't cause a predicted electoral meltdown.\n\nOn the trail, he has shown no willingness to moderate his positions, bragging about his conservative purity and his rabble-rousing reputation in the Capitol.\n\nBut even compared to Cruz's burn-it-down rhetoric, Trump's campaign has been more incendiary and worrisome for party elders determined to beat likely Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. The mogul had harsh things to say about Hispanics, prisoners of war, women in the media, the disabled, and most recently, Muslims, who he thinks temporarily should not be allowed to enter the United States.\n\nAnd most concerning for GOP leaders, Trump has frequently floated leaving the Republican Party altogether to mount an independent bid, which would significantly increase Clinton's chances of winning the White House.\n\nThe pair appears to be heading toward a clash that Cruz, at least, long sought to delay. On Friday evening, about 24 hours after audio leaked of Cruz questioning Trump's judgment at a private fundraiser, the real estate mogul launched his first attacks on Cruz.\n\nCruz had attempted to head that off by alleging that mainstream Republicans were trying to sow discord.\n\n\"The Establishment's only hope: Trump & me in a cage match,\" he tweeted Friday morning. \"Sorry to disappoint \u2014 @realdonaldtrump is terrific. #DealWithIt\"\n\nCruz has done little to woo the Republicans he used as his bogeyman: He has raised the lion's share of his money far from the New York-to-Washington corridor, raced to the party's right flank on every issue of the day, and campaigned loudly on the polarizing social issues that one well-placed Republican said puts some contributors permanently out of reach.\n\nCruz, on paper, should not be as repellent to the GOP political class as he is. Nurtured by the George W. Bush network in Texas, he served as solicitor general before winning an upset bid in the 2012 Republican U.S. Senate primary.\n\nTo Stuart Stevens, the chief strategist for Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign, that resume should theoretically make him attractive to the party's elite.\n\n\"At a core of Cruz's candidacy is a great phonyism,\" Stevens said of the self-stylized insurgent. \"You can wear all the plaid shirts and shoot off all the automatic weapons you want, but you're an insider.\"\n\nAnd some of his positions, such as on national security, do hew closely to the party's center. As Cruz held court on MSNBC's \"Morning Joe\" last week, \"you could've sworn he was working for George Herbert Walker Bush on his foreign policy,\" a senior Republican said.\n\nBut a leading Republican in frequent touch with high-level donors, said even though those contributors may despise Cruz, they are learning to live with him. \"If that's what we need to do to beat Trump,\" the Republican said, \"then that's what you get.\"", "73": "Hillary Clinton didn't just take the vast majority of the available delegates in South Carolina on Saturday night. She also took away one of Bernie Sanders's strongest arguments \u2014 that he's the candidate who has the most working-class support.\n\nIn Iowa and New Hampshire, Sanders had done better than Clinton among voters in the lowest income brackets. That seemed to bolster his claim that his \"political revolution\" could energize millions of new low-income voters who typically don't turn out to vote.\n\nThis argument, however, is much less tenable after tonight. Clinton did best among poor voters in South Carolina, taking 82 percent of those who earn under $30,000 on her way to a 37-point victory, according to exit polling by the New York Times.\n\nHere are the results by income, according to the Times:\n\nOf course, this discrepancy is largely driven by Clinton's huge 87-13 margin of victory over black voters. But that's the point \u2014 outside of states like Iowa and New Hampshire, many low-income and working-class voters aren't white. Unless Sanders is able to win working-class voters beyond the whitest electorates in the country, his revolution may be over almost as soon as it started.", "74": "Support Us Should I Get Botox? \nsource Add To The Conversation Using Facebook Comments November 1, 2016 at 6:25 am \nI think that maybe she can use a very natural makeup as an enhancement for her features to make her skin look softer and fresher.

If you want to actually take care of your skin and reduce the appearance of your wrinkles, you should do a deep chemical peel once a year, derma roll every month, and use prescription Retin-A in between those things. Keeping the skin hydrated and nourished with consistent exfoliation is the key to young skin. So vitamin e oil, steam facials and natural moisturizers on the regular.

Youth equals fertility, and \u2013 because we're animals \u2013 to attract a mate, generally it's about how \"fertile\" you appear.

Bush returned the admiration, calling Graham a \"patriot.\"\n\n\"He loves this country. You just hear it how he spoke from his heart about what's at stake here. What's at stake is our way of life,\" Bush said.\n\nJeb Bush \u2014 still slumping in polls \u2014 has been looking for a way to jump-start his campaign, but an endorsement from a former candidate who couldn't break through either probably won't give Bush the upswing he needs.\n\nWith the Iowa caucuses fewer than three weeks away, he's polling behind Trump, Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Ben Carson both nationally and in Iowa. Bush was unable to stand out from the field once again at Thursday's Republican presidential debate. And Bush's donors are reportedly getting skittish, saying it's only a matter of time before he drops out. Politico reported that several donors said they are now waiting for what one former George W. Bush administration appointee described as a \"family hall pass\" to switch to another campaign after the New Hampshire primary.", "76": "The fight for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination appears to be moving into a new, more fluid phase.\n\nNo longer is the question merely whether or how Donald Trump can be stopped.\n\nThe recent rise in the polls of retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson \u2014 Trump\u2019s low-key stylistic opposite \u2014 has shown that the celebrity billionaire may not be the only one who can tap the appetite of many in the party\u2019s angry base for an outsider.\n\nAnd after Wednesday\u2019s chaotic and freewheeling debate, there also is a new dynamic on the establishment side of the race.\n\nFormer Florida governor Jeb Bush\u2019s once-formidable campaign appears to be nearing a state of collapse, made worse by his flailing on the stage in Colorado.\n\nThat has provided an opening to his onetime ally, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who is getting a new look from the party establishment \u2014 an ironic situation, given Rubio\u2019s roots as an insurgent tea party favorite in 2010.\n\n\u201cMarco Rubio now has probably the best shot to emerge as the mainstream alternative to Trump and Carson,\u201d said Ari Fleischer, who was press secretary for President George W. Bush.\n\nMore broadly, Fleischer, who is not committed to any of the 2016 candidates, predicted that the GOP is about to enter \u201ca condensed version of where it was four years ago, where the party is volatile and shopping around.\u201d\n\nThat could help Ted Cruz, who also made a strong showing in the debate. The firebrand senator from Texas, widely despised by the Washington Republican hierarchy, is looking to nudge out Trump and Carson among voters who are looking for a candidate to supplant the old order.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the party is going to nominate anybody who has not been elected before,\u201d said Stuart Stevens, who was a top strategist for 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nAlso likely to force some clarity in the coming weeks is the calendar. The first contest, in Iowa, is barely more than three months away.\n\nSo the focus for all the leading contenders will have to shift, from raising their profiles nationally to refining the strategies and organization it will take to put specific states in their column.\n\n\u201cThe campaign is really in a\u00a0nuts-and-bolts stage,\u201d said Trump\u2019s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. \u201cIt\u2019s about getting on the ballot, organizing, and making sure people understand what caucuses are in Iowa and other states and teach them how to participate. It\u2019s about getting people committed and ready.\u201d\n\nLewandowski said Trump\u2019s campaign is already hiring staff for states that do not hold their primaries until March.\n\n\u201cOur approach is to execute and meet the criteria to get on the ballot in all 50 states, in five territories and in the District of Columbia. That\u2019s a full-time job,\u201d he added. \u201cThis campaign is doing all of the things necessary for long-term success.\u201d\n\nAt the same time, Trump seemed to be moderating and refining his message as he campaigned outside Reno, Nev., Thursday afternoon.\n\nWhere he previously has devoted his rallies to slinging insults at his opponents and boasting about his poll numbers, Trump focused instead on describing the professional and life experience he would bring to the White House.\n\nHe also cited issues where he claimed to have led before it was a popular thing to do \u2014 including opposing the Iraq war and aggressively combating illegal immigration.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the kind of thinking we need in the country,\u201d Trump said. \u201cA lot of the people in the audience, maybe in your small way you have that same thinking.\u201d\n\nBush, campaigning in New Hampshire, insisted that his struggling candidacy should not be counted out. The former Florida governor, who is polling in the single digits almost everywhere, insisted, \u201cWe\u2019re doing fine.\u201d\n\nBut he appeared to acknowledge that he had not helped his prospects with his showing in the debate.\n\n\u201cLook, there are two types of politicians. There are the talkers and there are the doers,\u201d Bush told the crowd. \u201cI wish I could talk as well as some of the people on the stage, the big personalities on the stage, but I\u2019m a doer.\u201d\n\nRubio, meanwhile, must capi\u00adtal\u00adize \u2014 quickly \u2014 on whatever interest and momentum may be generated by his debate performance. He spent the morning making the rounds of six network and cable television shows and the remainder of the day fundraising in Denver and Chicago. He will be in Iowa on Friday.\n\nOn \u201cCBS This Morning,\u201d Rubio declined to criticize Bush personally and said the differences between the two will be fleshed out in terms of policy.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to continue to tell people who I am, what I\u2019m for. There are policy differences between us \u2014 we\u2019ll discuss those. Americans deserve to hear those. But I\u2019m not going to change my campaign,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cJeb is my friend, I have admiration for him. I\u2019m not running against him. I\u2019m running for president.\u201d\n\nCruz, meanwhile, is building what GOP insiders say is a strong organization. The campaign says that it has 77,000 volunteers on the ground, with 6,000 in the first four voting states.\n\nFundraising has also been robust \u2014 and was reignited by the debate, during which the senator trained his fire on the CNBC moderators and the media. A Cruz aide said more than $1\u00a0million had poured in since Wednesday night\u2019s debate.\n\nThere will be growing pressure on candidates who are getting no traction to get out of the race. On Thursday, for instance, the New York Times editorial board called upon New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to abandon his bid.\n\n\u201cNew Jersey is in trouble, and the governor is off pursuing a presidential run that\u2019s turned out to be nothing more than a vanity project,\u201d the paper wrote. \u201cMr. Christie\u2019s numbers are in the basement, and he\u2019s nearly out of campaign cash. This is his moment, all right: to go home and use the rest of his term to clean out the barn, as Speaker John Boehner would say.\u201d\n\nChristie, for his part, tweeted, \u201cCan\u2019t read the article because I don\u2019t have a subscription, but I can tell you this \u2014 I am not going anywhere.\u201d\n\nRobert Costa in Colorado and Jenna\u00a0Johnson in Nevada contributed to this report.", "77": "The late evening of Aug. 9, 2014, I couldn\u2019t sleep. I was due to substitute-anchor MSNBC\u2019s \u201cUP with Steve Kornacki\u201d and should have been asleep. But after looking at my Twitter feed and reading the rage under #Ferguson, I felt compelled to type a reaction to the killing of Michael Brown by police officer Darren Wilson. Tying the shooting to the inane whine of certain politicians about a \u201cwar on whites,\u201d\u00a0 I decried the next morning the death of yet another unarmed black man at the hands of a white police officer.\n\nIn those early hours and early days, there was more unknown than known. But this month, the Justice Department released two must-read investigations connected to the killing of Brown that filled in blanks, corrected the record and brought sunlight to dark places by revealing ugly practices that institutionalized racism and hardship. They have also forced me to deal with two uncomfortable truths: Brown never surrendered with his hands up, and Wilson was justified in shooting Brown.\n\nThe report on the Ferguson police department detailed abuse and blatant trampling of the constitutional rights of people, mostly African Americans, in Ferguson. Years of mistreatment by the police, the courts and the municipal government, including evidence that all three balanced their books on the backs of the people of Ferguson, were laid bare in 102 damning pages. The overwhelming data from DOJ provided background and much-needed context for why a small St. Louis suburb most had never heard of exploded the moment Brown was killed. His death gave voice to many who suffered in silence.\n\nThe unarmed 18-year-old also became a potent symbol of the lack of trust between African Americans and law enforcement. Not just in Ferguson, but in the rest of the country. Lord knows there have been plenty of recent\u00a0examples. And the militarized response to protesters by local police put an exclamation point on demonstrators\u2019 concerns. But the other DOJ report, the one on the actual shooting of Michael Brown, shows him to be an inappropriate symbol.\n\nThrough exhaustive interviews with witnesses, cross-checking their statements with previous statements to authorities and the media, ballistics, DNA evidence and results from three autopsies, the Justice Department was able to present a credible and troubling picture of what happened on Canfield Drive. More credible than the grand jury decision to not indict Wilson. The transcript of his grand jury testimony read like so much hand-holding by the prosecution.\n\nWhat DOJ found made me ill. Wilson knew about the theft of the cigarillos from the convenience store and had a description of the suspects. Brown fought with the officer and tried to take his gun. And the popular hands-up storyline, which isn\u2019t corroborated by ballistic and DNA evidence and multiple witness statements, was perpetuated by Witness 101. In fact, just about everything said to the media by Witness 101, whom we all know as Dorian Johnson, the friend with Brown that day, was not supported by the evidence and other witness statements.\n\nPage 6: Brown then grabbed the weapon and struggled with Wilson to gain control of it. Wilson fired, striking Brown in the hand. Autopsy results and bullet trajectory, skin from Brown\u2019s palm on the outside of the SUV door as well as Brown\u2019s DNA on the inside of the driver\u2019s door corroborate Wilson\u2019s account that during the struggle, Brown used his right hand to grab and attempt to control Wilson\u2019s gun. According to three autopsies, Brown sustained a close range gunshot wound to the fleshy portion of his right hand at the base of his right thumb. Soot from the muzzle of the gun found embedded in the tissue of this wound coupled with indicia of thermal change from the heat of the muzzle indicate that Brown\u2019s hand was within inches of the muzzle of Wilson\u2019s gun when it was fired. The location of the recovered bullet in the side panel of the driver\u2019s door, just above Wilson\u2019s lap, also corroborates Wilson\u2019s account of the struggle over the gun and when the gun was fired, as do witness accounts that Wilson fired at least one shot from inside the SUV.\n\nPage 8: Although there are several individuals who have stated that Brown held his hands up in an unambiguous sign of surrender prior to Wilson shooting him dead, their accounts do not support a prosecution of Wilson. As detailed throughout this report, some of those accounts are inaccurate because they are inconsistent with the physical and forensic evidence; some of those accounts are materially inconsistent with that witness\u2019s own prior statements with no explanation, credible [or] otherwise, as to why those accounts changed over time. Certain other witnesses who originally stated Brown had his hands up in surrender recanted their original accounts, admitting that they did not witness the shooting or parts of it, despite what they initially reported either to federal or local law enforcement or to the media. Prosecutors did not rely on those accounts when making a prosecutive decision. While credible witnesses gave varying accounts of exactly what Brown was doing with his hands as he moved toward Wilson \u2013 i.e., balling them, holding them out, or pulling up his pants up \u2013 and varying accounts of how he was moving \u2013 i.e., \u201ccharging,\u201d moving in \u201cslow motion,\u201d or \u201crunning\u201d \u2013 they all establish that Brown was moving toward Wilson when Wilson shot him. Although some witnesses state that Brown held his hands up at shoulder level with his palms facing outward for a brief moment, these same witnesses describe Brown then dropping his hands and \u201ccharging\u201d at Wilson.\n\nThe DOJ report notes on page 44 that Johnson \u201cmade multiple statements to the media immediately following the incident that spawned the popular narrative that Wilson shot Brown execution-style as he held up his hands in surrender.\u201d In one of those interviews, Johnson told MSNBC that Brown was shot in the back by Wilson. It was then that Johnson said Brown stopped, turned around with his hands up and said, \u201cI don\u2019t have a gun, stop shooting!\u201d And, like that, \u201chands up, don\u2019t shoot\u201d became the mantra of a movement. But it was wrong, built on a lie.\n\nYet this does not diminish the importance of the real issues unearthed in Ferguson by Brown\u2019s death. Nor does it discredit what has become the larger \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d In fact, the false Ferguson narrative stuck because of concern over a distressing pattern of other police killings of unarmed African American men and boys around the time of Brown\u2019s death. Eric Garner was killed on a Staten Island street on July 17. John Crawford III was killed in a Wal-Mart in Beavercreek, Ohio, on Aug. 5, four days before Brown. Levar Jones survived being shot by a South Carolina state trooper on Sept. 4. Tamir Rice, 12 years old, was killed in a Cleveland park on Nov. 23, the day before the Ferguson grand jury opted not to indict Wilson. Sadly, the list has grown longer.\n\nNow that black lives matter to everyone, it is imperative that we continue marching for and giving voice to those killed in racially charged incidents at the hands of police and others. But we must never allow ourselves to march under the banner of a false narrative on behalf of someone who would otherwise offend our sense of right and wrong. And when we discover that we have, we must acknowledge it, admit our error and keep on marching.

", "80": "Democratic National Committee officials on Saturday turned down\u00a0Bernie Sanders' formal request for\u00a0the ouster of \u201caggressive attack surrogates\u201d for Hillary Clinton from key\u00a0national convention committees.\n\nThe campaign announced earlier that\u00a0it wanted\u00a0to remove\u00a0Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy as a co-chairman of the Platform Committee and former Massachusetts Rep. Barney Frank as head of the Rules Committee.\u00a0Frank\u00a0has\u00a0sharply criticized Sanders\u2019 positions on breaking up big banks and Malloy has criticized Sanders on guns.\n\n\u201cGovernor Malloy and Mr. Frank have both been aggressive attack surrogates for the Clinton campaign,\u201d Sanders campaign counsel Brad Deutsch\u00a0wrote in a letter\u00a0to the party\u2019s Rules and Bylaws Committee. \u201cTheir criticisms of Sen. Sanders have gone beyond dispassionate ideological disagreement and have exposed a deeper professional, political and personal hostility toward the senator and his campaign.\"\n\nBut committee co-chairs Jim Roosevelt and Lorraine Miller responded that his challenge \"fails to meet the criteria\" for their dismissal. It did not allege any violations in the conduct of their elections to their posts by the DNC executive committee in January, they wrote.\n\nThe Sanders campaign\u2019s Friday letter to Democratic National Committee rules officials marks the latest turn in Sanders\u2019 feud with party officials. It comes a week after Sanders said he would make sure Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida isn\u2019t reappointed to her role as head of the DNC if he becomes president and he began fundraising for her primary opponent, Tim Canova.\n\nMost members of the convention standing committees \u2014 rules, platform and credentials\u00a0\u2014\u00a0are awarded to candidates based on the results of those primaries and caucuses.\u00a0But under party rules, Wasserman Schultz recommended co-chairs and a slate of 25 at-large appointments per committee for approval by the party\u2019s executive committee.\n\nIn a May 6 letter to Wasserman Schultz, Sanders complained she selected only three of his more than 40 recommendations for committee appointments, and he expressed no confidence in Malloy or Frank, writing their appointments suggest\u00a0the committees are being established \u201cin an overtly partisan way.\u201d\n\nDeutsch argued Friday that Frank and Malloy can\u2019t be relied upon to perform convention duties fairly \u201cwhile laboring under such deeply held bias.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe appointment of two individuals so outspokenly critical of Sen. Sanders, and so closely affiliated with Secretary Clinton's campaign, raises concerns that two of the three Convention Standing Committees are being constituted in an overtly partisan way designed to exclude meaningful input from supporters of Sen. Sanders' candidacy,\u201d Deutsch wrote.\n\nIn April, Tad Devine, Sanders\u2019 senior adviser, said Frank is among surrogates for Hillary Clinton who used Sanders\u2019 remarks to a New York\u00a0Daily News editorial board on April 1 to promote a story line that questions Sanders\u2019 capacity to be president.\u00a0Devine pointed to Frank\u2019s April 6 statements on MSNBC that Sanders \u201cconfused several things\u201d in his responses to questions about his core issue of breaking up big banks. Frank also said Sanders\u2019 responses to the editorial board were not \u201ccoherent.\u201d\n\nFrank\u00a0said in an April interview with USA TODAY that he would step aside from his co-chairmanship if the Democratic nomination is still uncertain in June and if a Rules Committee decision could be the deciding factor. With Clinton's decisive lead in delegates, that appears unlikely.\n\nA Connecticut Democratic Party spokesman told USA TODAY earlier this month that Malloy\u00a0agrees with Sanders on many issues. On Saturday, Leigh Appleby said Malloy is committed to a platform and process reflective of the party's diverse viewpoints.\n\n\"This year's Democratic platform process is making an unprecedented effort to ensure the process is reflective of the entire party and that every Democrat has an opportunity to have their voice heard in a meaningful way,\" Appleby said in a statement. \"And at the end of the day, Democats will put forward a platform that stands in stark contrast to the hateful, divisive, and dangerous policies of Donald Trump.\"", "81": "NEW YORK, N.Y. \u2014 If Hillary Clinton is winning the Democratic presidential race, why has it felt like she\u2019s losing? Yes, Mrs. Clinton scored an important victory in New York Tuesday, winning her adopted home state in the primary. But should the outcome ever have been in doubt?As a former senator from New York she [\u2026]", "82": "WASHINGTON \u2014 President Obama has quietly racked up a series of legislative victories during the past few months as lawmakers have enthusiastically embraced his calls for a higher minimum wage, paid sick leave and universal pre-kindergarten.\n\nInstead of Capitol Hill, those victories happened in city halls, state houses and county buildings far from Washington.\n\nAt least six major cities \u2014 Chicago, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Seattle, Tacoma, Wash., and Washington, D.C. \u2014 have passed paid sick leave laws in the four months since Obama called for state and local action in this year's State of the Union Address. Since the 2013 address when Obama called for an increase in the minimum wage, 17 states and six major cities have taken action, including Los Angeles last week.\n\nObama's state-and-local strategy may be unprecedented in its scope and ambition. Though previous administrations have appointed top advisers to listen to concerns of state and local officials, the Obama White House appears to be the first to aggressively use those same channels to encourage them to adopt Obama's policies.\n\n\"It is a change in the paradigm, where we used to sit passively by waiting for elected officials to come to us. We think we can have a more substantial impact if we collaborate,\" said Valerie Jarrett, the assistant to the president for public engagement and intergovernmental affairs.\n\n\"I think the president has always had the perspective that change always happens from the ground up, and our state and local officials are oftentimes more influenced by the will of the American people than the politics in Washington would seem to indicate,\" Jarrett said in an interview.\n\nObama has no formal authority over state and local lawmakers, so his persuasion is a form of soft power \u2014 the \"phone\" part of what Obama has described as a \"pen-and-phone\" strategy to take action in the absence of congressional cooperation.\n\nHe's found fertile ground in Democratic-run cities such as Seattle, where Mayor Ed Murray helped push for a minimum wage and paid leave laws that have gone into effect since April.\n\n\"President Obama recognizes that good ideas are being incubated at the local level, and those are ideas that are going to go to scale nationally,\" Murray said. That recognition can go a long way in a city such as Seattle, which often doesn't get the national attention East Coast cities do. \"The president of the United States recognizing us only helps us. We do other things beside e-commerce and coffee,\" Murray said.\n\nThere's also resistance. Jon Russell is a councilman in Culpeper, Va., and the director of the American City County Exchange, a year-old initiative of the small-government American Legislative Exchange Council.\n\nRussell said states \u2014 not cities, not Congress and not the president \u2014 should be the primary regulator of labor conditions. Obama, he said, is \"hop-skipping over the states.\"\n\n\"With the number of states that have now turned to the opposite political party, he doesn't have the allies there that he used to,\" Russell said. \"To work with the urban areas to push his agenda is not surprising. It's the only allies he really has.\"\n\nThe strategy has been more effective on some policies than others. Since last September, more than 200 mayors have signed on to the My Brother's Keeper initiative, a commitment to help boys and young men of color. But since Obama called for states to offer free community college in January, only a handful have moved in that direction.\n\nThe state-and-local strategy effort has been particularly effective on paid leave policies, which Obama championed in his State of the Union Address this year. \"Forty-three million workers have no paid sick leave \u2014 43 million. Think about that,\" Obama said. \"So I'll be taking new action to help states adopt paid leave laws of their own.\"\n\nThat pledge came with a $1 million budget from the Department of Labor to help fund feasibility studies for state and local governments, which will begin to be awarded this summer.\n\nObama dispatched Jarrett and Labor Secretary Tom Perez on a \"Lead on Leave\" tour of cities that have adopted paid leave policies. Jarrett went to Philadelphia and Chicago; Perez has been to Portland, Ore., Pawtucket, R.I., St. Petersburg, Fla., and Seattle.\n\nTuesday, Perez will be in Minneapolis, which just adopted a paid leave policy for city employees this month.\n\nPerez said it's a mistake to view the state-and-local strategy as separate from a larger effort. \"Our strategy is an all-of-the-above-and-then-some strategy,\" he said.\n\nHe said Obama will continue to use executive orders, as he did when he increased the minimum wage for federal contractors to $10.10 an hour.\n\n\"We want Congress to act, and I'm confident that it's a when question, not an if question. But we're also not going to wait around for Congress to act,\" Perez said.\n\nAlthough focusing on city councils may seem small compared with the sweeping congressional legislation early in Obama's presidency, state minimum wage laws will raise the pay of more than 7 million people by 2017. (That number, which comes from the White House Council of Economic Advisers, includes people making just above minimum wage who were helped indirectly because their wages are increased accordingly.)\n\n\"That's nothing to sneeze at. That's progress,\" Jarrett said.\n\nSan Francisco passed the first paid sick time law in the nation in 2006, requiring all employers to grant one hour of paid sick time for every 30 hours worked. Three states and 18 cities now have paid sick leave laws on the books, according to A Better Balance, a New York-based legal advocacy group that tracks such laws.\n\nA year ago, advocates had a hard time breaking through the public consciousness on the issue, said the group's co-president, Sherry Leiwant. After a White House Working Families Summit last year, and again after January's State of the Union Address, there's been an \"explosion\" of interest by state and local lawmakers, she said.\n\n\"The White House leadership on this issue has been huge. It's had a real impact,\" Leiwant said. \"That influence on mayors or governors, who are Democrats but haven't paid a lot of attention to this issue, or they want to be pro-business Democrats, this gives them a lot of cover.\"\n\nA Better Balance still favors a national law that would cover everyone, but while the government is divided at the national level, \"the best strategy is to go to localities and states.\"\n\nA city-by-city strategy can be painstaking and legally complicated. Every state grants different home rule powers to cities \u2014 and even different powers to different-sized cities in the same state.\n\nPhiladelphia was able to pass a paid leave bill applying to private-sector workers, but Pittsburgh's law applies only to some non-union city workers. Pittsburgh City Councilwoman Natalia Rudiak credits Obama for giving her city's effort \"a lot of momentum,\" but she said more cities need to put pressure on the state Legislature to adopt statewide law.\n\nThere's also pushback from the opposite direction. Last month, the Pennsylvania Senate voted 37-12 to preempt the Philadelphia law, taking the power to regulate sick leave out of the hands of local governments.\n\nThat bill's sponsor, state Sen. John Eichelberger Jr., said it's untenable to have 2,562 municipalities with different labor standards, forcing businesses to comply with a patchwork of rules.\n\n\"Philosophically, I have a real problem with President Obama going to a municipality and trying to accomplish an agenda, whether it's liberal or conservative or otherwise,\" he said. \"It's just not the place to adopt these policies.\"\n\nObama has opened an entirely new frontier of presidential power by turning to state and local governments, said Matthew Eshbaugh-Soha, who studies the effect of presidential persuasion at the University of North Texas.\n\n\"I'm really struck by, one, why hasn't anybody thought of this before? And two, this could be a very effective strategy,\" Eshbaugh-Soha said. \"At a time when executive orders are becoming particularly controversial and you're not able to break through the gridlock of Congress, I think it's ingenious.\"\n\nHe's skeptical that the effort will put much pressure on members of Congress who don't support Obama's policies.\n\nJarrett said the effort is starting to snowball. She said some city leaders agreed with paid leave on principle but were reluctant to pass what could be seen as burdensome regulations in a difficult economy. As more cities and states have passed those policies, it's emboldened others.\n\n\"Success begets success,\" she said. \"What the evidence has begun to show is it's not a burden but an investment that is starting to pay off.\"\n\nIndeed, Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter vetoed two paid leave bills in 2011 and 2013. But three weeks after Obama's State of the Union Address this year, Nutter reversed course.\n\nWhat changed? Nutter said the economy was better, and the bill contained key compromises to accommodate small businesses. Nutter spokesman Mark McDonald said he was unaware of any role Obama had in getting the bill passed.\n\nBill Greenlee, the councilman who sponsored the measure, said Nutter \"completely turned a corner\" on paid leave when the president put it on his agenda. \"I gotta think that when the president mentions sick leave in his State of the Union, and if you're a Democrat and a supporter of the president's agenda in general, that's gotta have an effect,\" Greenlee said.\n\nNutter did make a symbolic nod to Obama's influence in signing the paid leave bill: He signed it with a pen Obama gave him \u2014 after the president used it to sign an unemployment compensation bill. The only other time Nutter used that pen was on an executive order raising the minimum wage for city contractors to $12 an hour.", "83": "Is Trump the lesser of two evils or are both candidates equally unelectable? \nTHE GREAT DEBATE BEGINS: We\u2019ll know who is right tomorrow! \nSARDONICUS (to Flopot) : I know it makes your blood boil to consider the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d scenario. But LD has always been a conscientious non-voter and is therefore unlikely to be voting for either Trump or Hillary. Nor am I for that matter, since I am a UK resident and do not get to vote in the American elections. \nYou really must reconcile yourself, Flopot, to the fact that Hillary is held in such visceral loathing that her millions of haters feel they have no option but to vote for her opponent, Donald Trump, even though they are aware of the Donald\u2019s many faults and his Zionist connections. \nIt\u2019s either not voting at all or voting for the lesser of two evils. \nFLOPOT : You don\u2019t understand the meaning of \u201clesser of two evils\u201d. It is a con trick; it doesn\u2019t exist. Donald will pursue the same globalist wars and cultural revolutions as any other Zionist puppet. It is a meme that exists to get your consent to continue the same evil. \nHARBINGER: Hear hear. Exactly Flopot. As I\u2019ve stated umpteen times, Trump is good cop, Hillary is bad. But sadly, Sardonicus does not see the \u2018grand plan\u2019 even though the likes of Zbigniew Brzezinski and Carroll Quigley do, both very much part of that process. \nThere is not one politician in the west who becomes what they are, without a careful vetting procedure. Classic example is Jeremy Corbin , whom many thought was going to be the saviour of Labour and take it to the Zionists, when he has proven without any shadow of a doubt that he\u2019s a rampant Zionist, even though who goes on pro Palestine marches. \nTrump is a puppet. Clinton is a puppet. May is a puppet. Merkel is a puppet\u2026.. There is not ONE politician in the west who isn\u2019t part of the \u2018grand plan\u2019 and it\u2019s why everything works according to plan. \nSARDONICUS (to Flopot and Harbinger) : Yes, I understand exactly what both you and Harbinger are saying and I can sympathize with your viewpoint. You are saying there is NO LESSER OF TWO EVILS here since both candidates are EQUALLY EVIL. Because both are Zionists and will deliver a program to further Jewish interests. That\u2019s what you\u2019re saying, right? \nThe only difference, as Harbie indicates, is that one of these two candidates is playing the \u201cbad cop\u201d (Hillary) and the other is playing the \u201cgood cop\u201d (Trump). So it\u2019s nonsense to vote for the \u201cgood cop\u201d as the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d when both cops are equally evil when the chips are down. \nThis is your argument and I can sympathize with it only if you are correct in your initial assumption that Trump has no redeeming features whatever and is a total charlatan and liar who will break every single promise of his if he gets into the White House. \nYou are entitled to that assumption, but you are NOT entitled to believe that your assumption is universally shared. Kevin MacDonald certainly doesn\u2019t believe that Trump is a thorough scoundrel who will sell all White America down the river as soon as he is elected. Nor do the thousands of White Nationalists and other White Americans who share MacDonald\u2019s perfectly acceptable and intellectually defensible views. \nThese millions of Trump supporters do NOT believe that Trump is an unmitigated scoundrel who will break his promise to build a wall to keep the Mexicans out. Trump has said he has no intention of starting a war with Russia. Hillary has made no such promise. Trump has said he will crack down on illegal immigrants, especially Muslim immigrants from hostile Muslim states. Well, MacDonald and his White Nationalists are giving Trump the benefit of the doubt. \nI for one refuse to think that Kevin MacDonald and the millions who are hoping for a resurgence of White ethnic interests are deluded and mistaken in their advocacy of Donald Trump. They could be right. Trump could be their man and actually deliver the goods, i.e., improve the lives of millions of White Americans who are now suffering under Jewish hegemony and a multiculturalism that has gone mad. \nThe pessimism both of you share in regard to the irredeemable character of Donald Trump is simply a subjective state of mind. It\u2019s an opinion, not a fact. \nI may choose to say, \u201cI can\u2019t stand garlic and onions.\u201d This makes me a garlic-and-onion pessimist. My subjective viewpoint that garlic and onions are horrible vegetables does not make it a scientific fact that garlic and onions are horrible vegetables. The garlic and onion eaters of the world are entitled to tell me to get lost if I told everyone to give up eating garlic and onions. \nSo it is with Flopot and Harbinger with their Trump pessimism. They are making a logical mistake in confusing impressions with facts. It is not a FACT that Trump is a scoundrel; at the most it is a subjective opinion. \nHP : Trump is not a politician who has been a politician who grew up a politician and lived and breathed politics all his adult life. Apart from business/social, of course. \nHe\u2019s an Alpha businessman who just happens to be waaay more intelligent and personally powerful than 99% of the political mediocres who envy and hate him. \nHe came from out of nowhere and like a freight train rolled right over them before they could even cry foul or man an offense against him based on their default slime factor M.O. \nHell, he vetted them ! Even as the entire weight of the political, M$M, Hollywood, Academia, foreigners, etc., etc., set upon him like no other in memory near or far. But they couldn\u2019t even put a dent in him, or scare him off, and you know the vile demons tried very hard. \nHe didn\u2019t scare. But he did and does scare them. A lot. \nBeing a uber-quick study, he easily overtook and surpassed the half-bright bureaucrat politicians and within one solitary year he IS The Alpha Politician. \nPutin (and his 12 time zones full of natural resources) will no doubt enjoy Trump. Putin will respect his intelligence, embrace his personality, utilize his uber-business talents and skills, and very very importantly, hugely importantly.. share their big big patriotism for their nations, their citizens.. \nIn other words: The world gets an early Christmas present this year! \nUNGENIUS: Well said, HP! I would add only one statement: Trump is not a murderer, but Killery is a murderer of long standing which should make a choice simple between the two. \nGILBERT HUNTLY: Sardonicus, thanks for your healthy and sane perspective! Well said! \ud83d\ude42 \nLOBRO: Seconding that.

Jeff Fortenberry, whose Nebraska district is home to the largest group of resettled Yazidis in the U.S., authored the resolution with California Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo.\n\nDuring debate on Monday, Fortenberry noted it was a rare instance of an issue that has \"risen above the petty and difficult differences we often work out on the floor of the House of Representatives.\"\n\nUnder a deadline set by Congress, the State Department had until Thursday to formally to decide whether it would issue a comprehensive genocide designation.\n\nKerry, though, had previously alluded to the possibility that the actions of ISIS, also know as ISIL, were genocide.\n\n\"ISIL's campaign of terror against the innocent, including the Yazidi and Christian minorities, and its grotesque targeted acts of violence, show all the warning signs of genocide,\" Kerry said in August 2014. \"For anyone who needed a wakeup call, this is it.\"\n\nFortenberry praised the State Department for its decision Thursday.\n\n\"I commend Secretary Kerry and the State Department for making this important designation. The genocide against Christians, Yazidis and others is not only a grave injustice to theses ancient faith communities -- it is an assault on human dignity and an attack on civilization itself,\" he said. \"The United States has now spoken with clarity and moral authority.\"\n\n\"That it took so long for the administration to arrive at this conclusion, in the face of unspeakable human suffering, defies explanation,\" Rubio, who until Tuesday was a GOP presidential candidate, said in a statement. \"At long last the United States is no longer silent in the face of this evil, but it would be travesty if we were to mistakenly take solace in this designation, if the designation did not then yield some sort of action.\"\n\n\"I am very happy to hear that (the U.S.) will recognize the genocide of Yezidi and Christian minorities,\" he told CNN in an email. \"This is an important step to stop the suffering of the persecuted people under the control of the extremist islamic groups, specially ISIS. And this is also important for my community to trust the international community again, because we were left in the hands of Islamic State.\"\n\nHe called on the State Department to push the U.N. to establish an international criminal court case on genocide against the Yazidis and Christians in Iraq and Syria.\n\n\"Furthermore,\" he said, \"it is necessary to give the minorities more support to be sure that (these) crimes will not happen again.\"\n\nAn international center advocating against hate, terrorism and anti-Semitism was one to join the chorus.\n\n\"The Simon Wiesenthal Center applauds Secretary Kerry's acknowledgement that Christians and Yazidis are targets of Genocide,\" the organization said in a statement. \"We reiterate our call that the U.S put these two groups at the front of the line for consideration for immigration to our country and to redouble our efforts to destroy ISIS.\"\n\nIn Defense of Christians, a group that has heavily lobbied for recognizing what is happening as genocide, put out a statement from its president Toufic Baaklini.\n\n\"IDC extends our deepest gratitude to Secretary Kerry and to the Obama administration for carefully reviewing the overwhelming evidence of the genocide against Christians, Yazidis, Shia Muslims and other religious minorities and for proclaiming the irrefutable truth that the crimes they have suffered constitute genocide,\" Baaklini said.\n\nAnd the Archbishop of Washington, Cardinal Donald Wuerl, put out a statement of \"appreciation.\"\n\n\"For some time, the world has witnessed the deliberate and organized effort by ISIS to eliminate Christians from the Middle East. For the U.S. government to call this savagery by its proper name -- genocide -- is a welcome step in what must now be a more committed effort at bringing peace and security to that beleaguered land,\" Wuerl said. \"These words must now be translated into action.\"", "85": "With the shake of an Etch-A-Sketch, Mitt Romney reintroduced himself to the Republican Party on Friday as a man interested in running for president because of his desire to address poverty and income inequality. One only wonders why the former governor of Massachusetts neglected to focus on the growing problems the last time he held the title of GOP standard bearer.\n\nAddressing a gathering of Republican National Committee officials below deck of the decommissioned U.S.S. Midway aircraft carrier in San Diego, California, Romney ticked off three priorities crucial to what he called the \"post-Obama era\": making the world safer with a more muscular foreign policy, providing opportunity to all Americans, and lifting people out of poverty.\n\n\"It's a tragedy, a human tragedy, that the middle class in this country by and large doesn't believe that the future will be better than the past,\" he said. \"We haven't seen rising incomes over decades.\"\n\n\"The rich have gotten richer, income inequality has gotten worse and there are more people in poverty than ever before under this president,\" he added.\n\nRomney stressed his years as an LDS pastor, a topic he and his campaign rarely broached in 2012, and described working \"with people who are very poor to help them get help.\"\n\nThe governor isn't the only potential Republican presidential candidate to embrace a more populist tone as wage growth continues to lag in an accelerating economic recovery. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush recently lamented that \"while the last eight years have been pretty good ones for top-earners, they've been a lost decade for the rest of America.\" Former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum has emphasized reconnecting with blue collar Americans. Even die-hard conservatives like Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Ted Cruz (R-Texas) paid lip service to the matter at the Heritage Foundation policy summit, an annual gathering of conservatives in Washington.\n\nWhile he may be sincere in his pursuit to eliminate poverty, the notion that Romney would be the best candidate to lead his party in doing so is puzzling at best. The former Massachusetts governor didn't have just one misstep that allowed Democrats and Republican primary opponents to paint him as an obscenely wealthy, out-of-touch plutocrat in the 2012 election -- he had a dozen. Here's just a brief sampling:\n\n\"I'm in this race because I care about Americans. I'm not concerned about the very poor. We have a safety net there. If it needs repair, I'll fix it,\" he said inelegantly following his victory in the Florida primary. \"I'm not concerned about the very rich, they're doing just fine. I'm concerned about the very heart of the America, the 90 percent, 95 percent of Americans who right now are struggling.\"\n\n\"Corporations are people, my friend ... of course they are. Everything corporations earn ultimately goes to the people,\" he said before the Iowa Ames straw poll.\n\nAnd his infamous remarks about \"47 percent\" of Americans: \"My job is not to worry about those people -- I'll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\"\n\nBut it's not just the gaffes. Romney embraced the Paul Ryan budget in 2012 -- a sweeping plan that, if enacted, would have instituted draconian cuts to programs affecting the poor. Millions of low-income Americans benefiting from Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, as well as other retirement funding, would have been affected under a Romney presidency. Added to his promise to repeal the Affordable Care Act and its subsidies for the poor, it's not hard to see how Romney wouldn't be vexed by some of the same problems should he ultimately decide to run for president.", "86": "\"We've got an opening on the court. I think Sandra Day O'Connor made a very practical point. Let's fill the vacancy so the court can fully function and get on with it,\" he told CNN's Chris Cuomo on \"New Day.\"\n\n\"I don't agree (with Republicans),\" said O'Connor. \"We need somebody in there to do the job and just get on with it.\"\n\nKing, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, said he is surprised that some Republicans have decided to reject a nominee before even having a candidate to evaluate.\n\n\"I'm surprised people can make that judgment before they even know who the nominee is,\" he said. \"It may be that he picks a nominee that's so eminently qualified that it would be very hard to explain a vote against him, other than politics.\" King acknowledged that the Senate doesn't have to support the nominee, but thinks there should be a vote. \"Of course, we have these debates. And of course, politics are involved,\" King said. \"The politics are important. And I'm not saying a Republican senator has to vote for whoever Obama nominates. I would never say that.\" But a refusal to hold a process could leave the vacancy for more than a year and that would be \"pretty troublesome,\" King said. The senator, who sits on the Senate Intelligence Committee, also expressed concern about a judge's order that Apple help the FBI break into the iPhone of one of the San Bernardino, California, shooters. \"They're asking Apple to create a key that does not currently exist. And I've got a problem with that. This is a very complicated issue,\" he said. Forcing Apple to do this could set \"a serious precedent\" that could lead to other citizens having their privacy invaded, he said. \"Once that key is made, it can end up in the hands of hackers,\" King said. \"There's no end to complications of this.\" \"I think we need to slow down and really consider the policy,\" he added.", "87": "I\u2019m not sure when it started, but at some point the Republican Party ceded the business of governance to the Democrats. Maybe it began with the Tea Party movement or Fox News or the larger conservative media-industrial complex \u2013 I honestly don\u2019t know. But it\u2019s clear now that the GOP is no longer a legitimate governing party. A party that allows rank neophytes like Herman Cain and Donald Trump and Ben Carson and Carly Fiorina to run for the highest office in the country has lost its way.\n\nIf you look at how the Republican Party operates today, it\u2019s hard to avoid the conclusion that governing just isn\u2019t a priority \u2013 or internal pressures within the party make it impossible. Instead, the GOP has become what I previously called a self-perpetuating hype machine for conservative political entrepreneurs. Particularly at the national level, Republican candidates and legislators (many of them, at least) show no interest in compromise or serious policymaking, which is what you\u2019d expect from a party of and for purists.\n\nWhile the new GOP has been bad for the country, it\u2019s been great for political celebrities, people looking to promote their personal brands. Ted Cruz is the most recent and obvious example of this approach to politics. Cruz has been a remarkably ineffective Senator. He has done nothing but bloviate and showboat on the Senate floor. He\u2019s accomplished zero legislatively. His only practical contribution has been to obstruct and draw attention to his martyrdom (read: presidential) campaign.\n\nTed Cruz will never be elected president. If he manages to win the Republican nomination, he\u2019ll lose in a landslide to a Democrat, whoever that happens to be. And because he\u2019s so eagerly made a spectacle of himself in the Senate, he\u2019s alienated all but the tiniest segment of his own party. Which means he has no political capital in Congress \u2013 hardly a concern for someone uninterested in legislating, however.\n\nCruz\u2019s latest squabble with Rand Paul helps to illustrate Cruz\u2019s intentions. In an interview with Fox News\u2019 Brian Kilmeade, Paul basically wrote Cruz\u2019s political obituary:\n\nTed has chosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership and call them names which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the senate, and as a consequence he can\u2019t get anything done legislatively. He is pretty much done for and stifled and it\u2019s really because of personal relationships, or lack of personal relationships, and it is a problem. I approach things a little different, I am still just as hardcore in saying what we are doing , I just chose not to call people liars on the Senate floor and it\u2019s just a matter of different perspectives on how best to get to the end result.\n\nPaul is right, of course, but he omits an essential point: Cruz has been ineffective by design. Managing relationships and respecting decorum only matter to people trying to accomplish things in the Senate \u2013 that\u2019s not what Cruz is up to. Like the fanatical Tea Party wing of the House, Cruz is there to obstruct and self-promote. In all likelihood, Cruz will retire after a single term in the Senate. Now that he\u2019s boosted his national profile and endeared himself to the insurgent elements of the base, he can pivot to the private sector and make more money as a professional conservative activist \u2013 as, for example, Jim DeMint did in 2012. Cruz ought to be seen as the grifter that he is. It was never about policy for him. When he leaves the Senate, he\u2019ll be a hero to the fringe right. He\u2019ll make a fortune on the conservative lecture circuit, telling rapturous audiences about his willingness to challenge the \u201cWashington cartel.\u201d It won\u2019t matter that he accomplished nothing, changed nothing \u2013 it\u2019ll be enough that he pretended to while he was there. The same is true of Carson and Trump and Fiorina and even politicians like Huckabee and Jindal: None of them will be president, but their over-the-top activism will ensure them a profitable career after politics. And that, I assume, is the whole point. The Democrats have their share of bad politicians, but you don\u2019t see this kind of faux activism and exploitation in their party.", "88": "President Obama's supporters sometimes wonder where the inspirational candidate of 2008 has gone. The answer is to the White House. Obama's presidency is about smaller, less inspiring questions than his 2008 campaign.\n\nObama's presidency is bounded by the limits of the office and the demands of the moment. It is about what America needs to do right now \u2014 the next budget, the next bill, next year's taxes, the last war. Candidates can muse. Presidents must govern.\n\nObama's 2008 campaign was about what kind of country America is; how to read its past to best guide its future. His speech in Selma \u2014 which is really\u00a0worth reading in its entirety \u2014 was among the best of his presidency precisely because it had almost nothing to do with his presidency; it was a return to the central topic of his campaign.\n\nHistorians who want to understand Obama will find few better summations than the two paragraphs at the core of this speech:\n\nWe do a disservice to the cause of justice by intimating that bias and discrimination are immutable, or that racial division is inherent to America. If you think nothing's changed in the past fifty years, ask somebody who lived through the Selma or Chicago or L.A. of the Fifties. Ask the female CEO who once might have been assigned to the secretarial pool if nothing's changed. Ask your gay friend if it's easier to be out and proud in America now than it was thirty years ago. To deny this progress \u2014 our progress \u2014 would be to rob us of our own agency; our responsibility to do what we can to make America better. Of course, a more common mistake is to suggest that racism is banished, that the work that drew men and women to Selma is complete, and that whatever racial tensions remain are a consequence of those seeking to play the \"race card\" for their own purposes. We don't need the Ferguson report to know that's not true. We just need to open our eyes, and ears, and hearts, to know that this nation's racial history still casts its long shadow upon us. We know the march is not yet over, the race is not yet won, and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character requires admitting as much.\n\nThose 230 words are a precise distillation of Obama's view of America, and the role politics must play in it.\n\nThe first paragraph is Obama's case for hope: America is improving; it has always been improving, and to deny that improvement is to steal from Americans a belief in their country that they have more than earned. \"To deny this progress \u2014 our progress \u2014 would be to rob us of our own agency,\" he said.\n\nThe second paragraph is Obama's case for change: America's sins are not vanquished; its hatreds remain real; its racism still breathes. \"We know the march is not yet over,\" Obama said, \"the race is not yet won, and that reaching that blessed destination where we are judged by the content of our character requires admitting as much.\"\n\nHope and change. These are the two ideas that form the steady core of Obama's politics. But, more than that, they are the two ideas that define, for Obama, what kind of country America is \u2014 and what it means to serve it.\n\nObama's critics question his love for the country he governs. \"I do not believe \u2014 and I know this is a horrible thing to say \u2014 but I do not believe that the president loves America,\" former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani said in February. They look at Obama's steady belief that America is not yet good enough, not yet pure enough, not yet perfect enough, and they see a skeptic, not a patriot.\n\nIn this speech, Obama's answer to this criticism was direct:\n\nFellow marchers, so much has changed in fifty years. We've endured war, and fashioned peace. We've seen technological wonders that touch every aspect of our lives, and take for granted convenience our parents might scarcely imagine. But what has not changed is the imperative of citizenship, that willingness of a 26 year-old deacon, or a Unitarian minister, or a young mother of five, to decide they loved this country so much that they'd risk everything to realize its promise. That's what it means to love America. That's what it means to believe in America. That's what it means when we say America is exceptional.\n\nThere is an implicit radicalism in what Obama is saying here.\u00a0To believe America is good enough is to abandon the tradition of criticism and activism that has made America great.\n\nObama's answer to Giuliani is that Giuliani has mistaken uncritical adoration for the hard work required of true love. Patriotism is active, not passive. Those who love America prove it by working to perfect America. They continue marching.", "89": "NEW YORK - Bernie Sanders is at a crossroads.\n\nThe Vermont senator took Wednesday off the campaign trail at home alone with his wife, leaving his top aides behind in Washington to cool their heels.\n\n\"He wanted an opportunity to think,\" said Sanders senior strategist Tad Devine. \"It's affording him an opportunity to think about where we are in the campaign, what he wants to say in the weeks ahead. He hasn't had a real chance to do that\" in weeks.\n\nThe Sanders campaign poured itself into New York, throwing a hail mary pass to try to change the delegate math while they could. They spent $5.6 million (twice what Hillary Clinton did), made 3 million phone calls in the final weekend alone, and organized the biggest rallies of a campaign defined by big rallies.\n\nBut in the end Sanders came up short - not just of winning, but of the delegate target allies had aimed to hit, which might set them up for a path through California, the campaign's final hope.\n\nNow, with the nomination even further out of reach, Sanders faces the difficult question about what comes next. Does he set a do-whatever-it-takes course to actually win the Democratic nomination? Or does he return to the message campaign his long-shot White House bid was originally seen as?\n\nThere's no question that Sanders will stay in the race either way. \"Bernie made a decision after Nevada that he was going to go through this process and finish it up by letting everybody who wanted to vote, vote,\" Devine said.\n\nDemocratic primary voters have shown no sign they're in a rush for the race to settle down, and seem hungry for Sanders' message, if not his presidency.\n\nHe'll continue to draw massive crowds from zealous fans, who have almost literally given his campaign a blank check to do as they wish. On Wednesday night, the campaign announced raising $15 million more than Clinton in March, though they also spent much more.\n\nBut even some Sanders allies cringed at parts of the candidate's message in New York, where his agenda was sometimes obscured by a focus on Clinton and issues with the election process.\n\n\"Going forward, what we're encouraging Senator Sanders to do is to continue to keep the campaign focused on the issues,\" said Neil Sroka, the communications director of Democracy for America, which backs Sanders.\n\nThe campaign says they want to return to more substantive issues - but only as long as the Clinton campaign joins them. So far, at least, they believe Clinton forces are keeping up the heat and see it as sign Clinton still views Sanders as a threat.\n\nPrivately, some Sanders allies say it's time for the candidate to start to thinking more about how he maximizes his leverage at the Democratic National Convention, and afterwards, and less about beating Clinton at all costs.\n\nOne indicator of which kind of campaign Sanders wants to run is how much he and his aides continue to talk about relying on super delegates to hand them the nomination.\n\nThe strategy, which calls for wooing the unelected delegates even if Sanders loses more primaries and caucuses, was floated by campaign manager Jeff Weaver with MSNBC's Steve Kornacki late Tuesday night.\n\nMoveOn.org and Democracy for America, both of which have endorsed Sanders, have since 2008 been pressuring super delegates to support whichever candidate gets the most votes.\n\nMore than 380,000 people signed petitions from the group agreeing that \"the race for the Democratic Party nomination should be decided by who gets the most votes, and not who has the most support from party insiders.\"\n\nBoth groups confirmed to MSNBC Wednesday that they still hold that position.\n\n\"MoveOn members overwhelmingly endorsed Sanders for president, and we want him to win the most pledged delegates, become the nominee, and become president. But superdelegates shouldn't overrule the will of the Democratic grassroots,\" said MoveOn Washington Director Ben Wikler. \"If the primary and caucus winner is Hillary Clinton, then Clinton should be the nominee.\"\n\nDevine said the campaign's main focus is still to win pledged delegates. But if Sanders falls just short of a majority, it's negligible - \"de minims,\" Devine said - and the campaign will pitch super delegates that Sanders is the stronger general election candidate.\n\nAnother indication of Sanders' intentions will be where he devotes his precious time in the days leading up to Tuesday's contests.\n\nFive states are voting and Maryland is expected to be Sanders' worst showing.\n\nIf he invests heavily there it's a sign his campaign is still focused on winning and scraping together delegates. If he spends time in states like Connecticut and Delaware to try to eek out wins despite limited delegate opportunities, it's a sign he's more focused on moral victories than ones that lead to the nomination.\n\nWhat Sanders decides to do, and how aggressively he decides to continuing pursuing Clinton, will help determine the shape of the rest of the primary and how quickly Clinton, the odds-on nominee, can unite the party.\n\nClinton's favorability rating has tumbled during the primary, especially among Sanders voters, presumably at least in part due to his attacks.\n\nBut as Democratic leaders worry about the damage, the party seem to be enjoying the contest.\n\nNational polling between Clinton and Sanders has tightened to a virtual dead heat, suggesting voters are not ready to settle on Clinton. Exit polls showed two-thirds of New York primary voters found the heated contest in the state to be energizing, not divisive.\n\n\"Mr. Sanders's presence has made this an immeasurably more substantive race,\" The New York Times wrote in an editorial Wednesday calling on Sanders to ignore calls to leave the race, which was shared by the Sanders campaign. The enthusiasm of his supporters \"should be a wake-up call to leaders of both parties. They are missing something big about their own members' priorities, and their mood.\"\n\nStill, Sanders' entire campaign has been about bringing new people into politics and the Democratic party. At some point, he might risk pushing them back out again.", "90": "Killing Obama administration rules, dismantling Obamacare and pushing through tax reform are on the early to-do list.", "91": "  Revelation Unleashed: Unlocking The Mysteries Of The Bible\u2019s Most Mysterious Book On this episode of Rightly Dividing, join us as we drop some pins and create an easy to understand roadmap to the amazing, awesome, and very much knowable book of Revelation!

He put the following video up on his YouTube channel at noon today and says that the channel was down twenty minutes later. \nCurrently, that channel is up, so perhaps our channel will not be harmed. \nI believe what you are about to see is true because of the nature of the recent WikiLeaks revelations.

The first lady was subpoenaed to testify as a witness in the investigation of the Whitewater land deal in Arkansas. The Clintons' business investment was investigated, but ultimately they were cleared of any wrongdoing.\n\nClinton looks on as her husband discusses the Monica Lewinsky scandal in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on January 26, 1998. Clinton declared, \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman.\" In August of that year, Clinton testified before a grand jury and admitted to having \"inappropriate intimate contact\" with Lewinsky, but he said it did not constitute sexual relations because they had not had intercourse.

In 2015, The New York Times reported that Clinton exclusively used a personal email account during her time as secretary of state. The account, fed through its own server, raises security and preservation concerns. Clinton later said she used a private domain out of \"convenience,\" but admits in retrospect \"it would have been better\" to use multiple emails.\n\nClinton testifies about the Benghazi attack during a House committee meeting in October 2015. \"I would imagine I have thought more about what happened than all of you put together,\" she said during the 11-hour hearing. \"I have lost more sleep than all of you put together. I have been wracking my brain about what more could have been done or should have been done.\" Months earlier, Clinton had acknowledged a \"systemic breakdown\" as cited by an Accountability Review Board, and she said that her department was taking additional steps to increase security at U.S. diplomatic facilities.\n\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders shares a lighthearted moment with Clinton during a Democratic presidential debate in October 2015.

French police hunted Thursday for two heavily armed men, one with a terrorism conviction and a history in jihadi networks, in the methodical killing of 12 people at a satirical newspaper that caricatured the Prophet Muhammad. The prime minister announced several overnight arrests and said the possibility of a new attack \u201cis our main concern.\u201d\n\nFrench authorities are searching for two chief suspects in Wednesday's deadly attack in Paris on the offices of Charlie Hebdo, a satirical magazine,\u00a0which left 12 people dead in France's deadliest terrorist incident in a generation.\n\nThousands of police and\u00a0counter-terrorism officers are searching in northern France for the two armed suspects,\u00a0Said and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi, who are brothers, remain at large.\u00a0A third suspect, Hamyd Mourad, turned himself in at a police station in a small town about 145 miles northeast of Paris after learning his name was linked to the attack.\n\nSpeaking on RTL radio, Prime Minister Manuel Valls said authorities had made several overnight arrests and that the possibility of a new attack by the two suspects \u201cis our main concern,\u201d The New York Times reports. An unnamed security official put the arrest total at seven.\n\n\u201cWe are facing an unprecedented terrorist threat, both internally and externally,\u201d Mr. Valls said, adding that, \u201cthere was not zero risk.\u201d\n\nIn an incident likely to rattle nerves in Paris, a\u00a0policewoman was killed in a shootout in southern Paris on Thursday morning. The shooting\u00a0set off searches\u00a0in the area as the manhunt for the two brothers expanded, but police didn't immediately link it to the Charlie Hebdo attack, Reuters reports. The policewoman wasn't involved in the manhunt for the suspects and had been called to a routine traffic incident.\n\nValls said the suspects in the attack on Charlie Hebdo were known to French authorities and had been tracked before. Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi was convicted of abetting terrorism in 2008 for recruiting jihadists to fight in Iraq, the Associated Press reports. Both brothers were also named in connection with a plot to help an Islamic extremist, who bombed a Paris metro station in 1995, escape from jail.\n\nThe brothers are Algerian-origin French citizens who lived in Paris, the BBC reports.\n\nGiven his track record, the fact that Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi allegedly pulled off such a brazen attack may raise concerns in France and across Europe. It's still unclear whether the brothers had any foreign support or trained abroad. European security agencies fear that militants from Europe who fight in Iraq and Syria could in future\u00a0stage attacks at home.\n\nThe Christian Science Monitor reports that France has Europe\u2019s largest Muslim population and the largest number of citizens who have joined groups such as the self-described Islamic State. Some 1,000 French have traveled to fight in Syria, according to authorities.\n\nCharlie Hebdo, which directs its irrelevant satire at almost everyone, has repeatedly offended Muslims for its caricatures of the prophet Muhammad.

Now, because this is the biggest display of sheer Power, there are a lot of government agencies whose only job is to make you think that they have power who are sitting down and yelling \"we did it, we are the ones and we did it with our collider!\" And there's others sitting down and yelling \"we did it, with our d computers!\" These collider and d computers are jokes, they can't do anything, you can barely play pacman on them - they are just impressive looking things to you which make you scared of the people who want to control you.

We owe our service members the very best, but unless Congress acts, on January 1 more than 9 million veterans who rely on Social Security benefits or pension and compensation benefits will not get their annual cost of living increase.\n\nThis freeze in funds, which has happened only two other times since 1975, will be really tough on veterans among the 71 million Americans who depend on Social Security and other benefits to help make ends meet. Two-thirds of seniors depend on Social Security for the majority of their income, and for 15 million Americans, Social Security is all that stands between them and poverty.\n\nWhile vets and seniors get no raise, CEOs at the top 350 American companies received, on average, a 3.9% pay increase last year. That's a lot of money. The average CEO at one of the top 350 American companies made $16.3 million and got more than half a million in pay raises. So CEOs get huge raises, while seniors, veterans and others who've worked hard don't get an extra dime. Why? It's not an accident. It's not inevitable. It's the result of deliberate policies set by Congress.\n\nSocial Security is supposed to be indexed to inflation so that when prices go up, benefits go up, too. But Congress' formula samples the spending patterns of about a quarter of the country, and the formula isn't geared to what older Americans actually spend.\n\nProjections for the costs of core goods and services show inflation is up about 2%, but seniors won't get a cost of living increase -- mostly because of falling gasoline prices, which don't mean as much to millions of seniors who don't commute to work. So seniors, who are already struggling to scrape by to cover rent and exploding prescription drug prices , will be left scrambling.\n\nSure, companies should make their own decisions about how much to compensate executives, but because of the laws Congress has passed, American taxpayers are forced to subsidize these multimillion-dollar pay packages.\n\nIt's time for Congress to make different choices. That's why last week I introduced the Seniors And Veterans Emergency (SAVE) Benefits Act. The SAVE Benefits Act will give seniors on Social Security, veterans, those with disabilities and others a one-time payment in 2016 equivalent to an average increase of 3.9% -- the same as the taxpayer-subsidized raise that CEOs received last year.\n\nWe can afford to give seniors and vets a raise. In fact, we can increase pay for seniors and vets without adding a single penny to the deficit simply by closing the bonus loophole for corporate executives. According to the chief actuary of the Social Security Administration, closing this loophole will create enough revenue to help millions of Americans and still have enough left over to help extend the life of the Social Security trust fund.\n\nSeniors and vets would get an increase of about $581 next year \u2014 a little less than $50 a month. That $581 increase would cover almost three months of groceries for seniors or a year's worth of out-of-pocket costs on critical prescription drugs for the average Medicare beneficiary. That $50 a month is worth a lot to those 71 million Americans. According to an analysis from the Economic Policy Institute, that little boost could lift more than 1 million Americans out of poverty.\n\nGiving vets and seniors a little help and stitching up these corporate tax write-offs isn't just about economics; it's about our values. For too long, we've listened to a handful of people with money and power who say: Cut taxes for those at the top, cut rules and regulations that keep everyone honest, and let everyone else fight over the scraps. We tried trickle-down economics, and it failed.\n\nBut we can make different choices -- choices that reflect our values. We don't have to ignore this problem. We can give a small boost to 71 million Americans who have earned it and who need it.\n\nWe can lift over 1 million people out of poverty. We can extend the life of Social Security. And we can do it by shutting down taxpayer giveaways to a handful of wealthy corporations that will do fine without them. For me, this is simple. Our spending should reflect our values, and that means passing the SAVE Benefits Act.", "98": "Sparks flew at the toughest and liveliest GOP primary debate yet Saturday night, as Donald Trump and Jeb Bush clashed over the Middle East and George W. Bush\u2019s legacy, trading insults at a rapid clip \u2013 and the two Cuban-American senators in the race accused each other of lying on immigration and even questioned each other\u2019s Spanish-speaking skills.\n\nAnd just when it seemed Trump and Ted Cruz might steer clear of each other, the two leading Republican candidates entered the ring toward the end of the debate when the Texas senator questioned the billionaire businessman\u2019s pro-life credentials.\n\n\u201cYou are the single biggest liar. You\u2019re probably worse than Jeb Bush,\u201d Trump said.\n\nCruz stood his ground, charging that Trump would \u201cappoint liberals\u201d to the Supreme Court if elected.\n\nThe issue of judicial appointments was front and center at the CBS News-hosted debate in Greenville, S.C., in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death, with candidates like Cruz saying it underscores the high stakes in this election. Several candidates called for a delay in any high court appointment or confirmation.\n\nBut the barbed and often personal exchanges Saturday marked a new phase of the race, as the candidates charge into next week\u2019s critical South Carolina primary. The clashes left Ohio Gov. John Kasich \u2013 the affable, second-place finisher in the New Hampshire primary \u2013 making an appeal for peace in the GOP field, albeit one unlikely to be heeded.\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019re fixing to lose the election to Hillary Clinton if we don\u2019t stop this,\u201d Kasich said.\n\nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, too, warned about the coming general election and said, \u201cWe cannot be tearing each other down.\u201d\n\nThe appeals came shortly after Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio accused each other of being soft on illegal immigration. It\u2019s an argument they\u2019ve had before \u2013 Cruz faults Rubio for backing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that included a path to legal status, and Rubio says Cruz was on board with that effort \u2013 but this time, it became more heated. And after Cruz accused Rubio of saying on Univision he wouldn\u2019t rescind President Obama\u2019s immigration executive orders on day one, Rubio quipped:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how he knows what I said on Univision because he doesn\u2019t speak Spanish,\u201d Rubio said.\n\nCruz, then, immediately began debating Rubio in Spanish. Rubio continued, saying Cruz \u201clies about all sorts of things\u201d and indeed supports legalizing illegal immigrants.\n\nAs the Rubio-Cruz battle heated up, so did the long-simmering feud between Trump and Bush.\n\n\u201cThis is a man who insults his way to the nomination,\u201d Bush said of Trump.\n\nWith Bush attempting a comeback in the race after a fourth-place finish in New Hampshire, Trump faced a feistier debate rival on stage Saturday night than he has before \u2013 boosted in part by what seemed to be a sympathetic audience.\n\nThe audience often booed Trump when he took on Bush, though Trump once again accused them of representing Bush\u2019s \u201cspecial interests and lobbyists.\u201d\n\nTheir most personal dispute came when Trump accused Bush of promoting a policy that would get the U.S. mired more deeply in the Middle East \u2013 and blamed the former Florida governor\u2019s brother for the problems there.\n\nTrump initially took issue with Jeb Bush\u2019s call to confront ISIS while also taking on Syria\u2019s Bashar Assad and sidelining Russia.\n\n\u201cJeb is so wrong,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou have to knock out ISIS. .... You decide what you have to do after. You can\u2019t fight two wars at one time.\u201d\n\nBush, though, said Russia is not a U.S. ally, and Assad\u2019s hold on power prevents a resolution in the war. Trump then went on to repeatedly slam the decision under the George W. Bush administration to enter Iraq in the first place, calling it a \u201cbig fat mistake\u201d that \u201cdestabilized the Middle East.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey lied\u201d about WMDs, he said.\n\n\u201cI am sick and tired of him going after my family,\u201d Jeb Bush countered, saying he\u2019s proud of his brother\u2019s efforts to keep the country safe.\n\nTrump then invoked 9/11: \u201cThe World Trade Center came down \u2026 That\u2019s not keeping us safe.\u201d\n\nRubio, who has often been at odds with Bush, leapt to his brother\u2019s defense, saying the Bush administration \u201ckept us safe.\u201d\n\nJeb Bush joked that he was rescinding Trump\u2019s invitation to an upcoming rally with George W. Bush on the campaign trail.\n\nThe fireworks flew after the debate started on a somber note, discussing the legacy of Supreme Court Justice Scalia and the impact his death Saturday will have.\n\nSeveral candidates urged President Obama to refrain from nominating anybody to fill the vacancy, and wait for the next president to make that decision. Trump, though, said he doesn\u2019t expect Obama to wait, and called on Senate Republicans to hold up any nomination.\n\nKasich urged Obama to put the \u201ccountry first\u201d and not move forward with a nomination, a plea echoed by Rubio. Obama, though, said minutes before the start of the debate that he indeed plans to nominate a successor.\n\nThe GOP candidates, meanwhile, used opening remarks to honor Scalia\u2019s legacy.\n\nCruz called him a \u201clegal giant\u201d who \u201cchanged the arc of American legal history.\u201d He said Scalia\u2019s death also \u201cunderscores the stakes of this election.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are one justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion\u201d by states, threaten gun rights and \u201cundermine\u201d religious liberty, Cruz said. He said he would appoint a strict constitutionalist if elected.\n\nScalia\u2019s death thrusts the issue of judicial appointments into the 2016 race, raising the possibility that the next president immediately will have to fill a high court vacancy. While Obama vowed Saturday to nominate a successor, it\u2019s unclear whether he can get any appointee confirmed in the Republican-led Senate.\n\nWhile the prospect of a Supreme Court vacancy now looms over the race, the South Carolina primary already was heating up on several fronts in recent days, with the candidates trading accusations on immigration and other issues.\n\nThe debate Saturday reflects that tougher tone, in a state notorious for bare-knuckle primary battles. Trump at one point accused Cruz of trying to spread rumors in the state that he\u2019s not running in South Carolina \u2013 likening that to his campaign\u2019s actions in Iowa, where representatives spread false rumors that Carson was dropping out.\n\n\u201cNasty guy, now I know why he doesn\u2019t have one endorsement from any of his colleagues,\u201d Trump said.\n\nEven Kasich struggled to avoid the fray, as Bush criticized him for expanding Medicaid under ObamaCare and said that would create more debt.\n\n\u201cHe knows that I\u2019m not for ObamaCare,\u201d Kasich said, before vowing to stay \u201cpositive. \u201c\n\nThe GOP field is now down to six candidates -- after New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Hewlett Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina dropped out following low finishes Tuesday in the New Hampshire primary.\n\nA big question Saturday night, and going forward, was whether Rubio could regain his momentum \u2013 following last weekend\u2019s lackluster performance. A withering attack by Christie on Rubio, which had the Florida senator repeating himself, appeared to hurt him in the New Hampshire primary. Rubio himself blamed his debate performance in part for his fifth-place finish in the state. He finished behind Trump, Kasich, Cruz and Bush. Christie, though, is no longer on stage or in the race.\n\nMost polling in South Carolina still shows Rubio third, with Trump and Cruz in the top two positions, respectively.", "99": "The online comment fits closely with his campaign platform.", "100": "In 2008, in the high-profile Supreme Court gun-rights case called District of Columbia v. Heller, a brief was filed from the eighth floor of the Price Daniel Sr. State Office Building in Austin, Texas, specifically from the corner office of the man who was then the state\u2019s solicitor general, Ted Cruz.\n\nThe brief took a strong stance on the divisive question of whether the Second Amendment establishes an individual right to own guns, or just protects state and local militias. The brief argued forcefully for the first view, writing that \u201cthe individual right to keep and bear arms\u201d is a \u201cfundamental right\u201d and that \u201can individual right that can be altogether abrogated is no right at all.\u201d Thirty attorneys general from other states signed on.\n\nToday, with the White House pushing new gun restrictions and Cruz's candidacy riding on next month's Iowa caucuses, it's no surprise that the Texas Republican would embrace gun rights as a defining issue, holding an event at a firing range and even raffling off an engraved 12-gauge shotgun as a campaign promotion.\n\nIn 2008, the situation was very different: he was wading into a case that had no immediate connection to Texas at all. But to see the signature of R. Ted Cruz on the brief would not have surprised the nine Supreme Court justices in the least. By that time, Cruz had been solicitor general for five years, and inserting himself into a case of wide prominence and importance regardless of any direct tie to Texas had become part of his playbook. He clearly saw the Heller case as a watershed in gun rights, writing that it would \u201cdetermine whether the Second Amendment has any modern relevance.\u201d And he was right. The Supreme Court in a 5-4 decision shot down the Washington, D.C., handgun ban and ruled for the first time in the history of this country that the amendment ensures an individual person\u2019s right to have a gun for self-defense. The National Rifle Association recognized Cruz\u2019s role with a resolution.\n\nAs Cruz climbs to the top of the Republican presidential field, the five-plus years he served as the solicitor general of Texas remain the most important period in his public r\u00e9sum\u00e9. They\u2019re the record he ran on when he was elected to the U.S. Senate in 2012\u2014and they represent significantly more of his working life than the three years he has served so far in the Senate. They're also a prime source of fodder for liberal and moderate critics, should be become the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nA Politico review of Cruz\u2019s record as solicitor general shows he used the role in a new and far more ideological way than his predecessors, taking a relatively low-profile job that had traditionally been used mostly to defend the state government and turning it into a stage for pushing national conservative causes. Cruz argued eight cases in front of the U.S. Supreme Court\u2014far more than his predecessors and successors\u2014using each of them to advance a position endorsed by conservative thinkers. He also was the counsel of record on some 70 friend-of-the-court briefs, or amicus briefs, weighing in on cases across the country, like Heller, in which Texas had no direct stake, but which similarly offered a chance to argue ideological points.\n\n\u201cHe really turned the office into a platform,\u201d David Bernstein, a George Mason law professor who recently wrote a book about the Obama administration for which Cruz wrote the foreword, said in an interview.\n\n\u201cHe built up the national aura of the office,\u201d said Tom Phillips, who was the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Texas at the start of Cruz\u2019s run as solicitor general.\n\nCruz\u2019s zealous work served the ambitions of the conservative movement, but he also personally used it to build a bridge between what he was (an elite constitutional law nerd) to what he is today (an ascendant right-wing politician). Yet while pleasing to conservatives, other aspects of his record are sure to attract critics. He argued against leniency for an unjustly sentenced man whose lawyer had made a technical mistake; he invoked 13th-century \u201cSaxon law\u201d and the practice of cutting off testicles to justify harsher punishments in a rape case; and he referred to a late-term abortion technique as \u201cinfanticide.\u201d\n\nAlthough little examined in the race so far, Cruz\u2019s time as solicitor general built him a powerful allegiance among the conservative donors necessary to launch a national campaign. Heading into Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and beyond, he has more money at his disposal than any candidate besides Jeb Bush. And the way he used that Texas office is part of the reason. Toby Neugebauer, who wrote a $10 million check to the Cruz super PAC called Keep the Promise II, told me the reason he did that\u2014the single reason\u2014is what Cruz did as solicitor general. He said other major donors feel the same way.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re backing someone,\u201d Neugebauer told me, \u201cthat had a worldview and went out and executed on it.\u201d\n\nCruz took the solicitor job as a reboot of sorts after his initial foray into politics had fizzled.\n\nAs a debater at Princeton, as a law school student at Harvard, and as a clerk to then-Supreme Court Chief Justice William Rehnquist, Cruz was widely considered brilliant\u2014but he left his first real job as a promising appellate attorney in private practice in Washington to instead toil in 2000 as a domestic policy analyst in George W. Bush\u2019s presidential campaign, then as a legal hand for Bush\u2019s team in the frantic recount in Florida that ultimately won Bush the election.\n\nIn return, Cruz \u201cdesperately\u201d wanted \u201ca senior post\u201d in the White House, he wrote in his autobiography. On the campaign, though, he had earned a reputation for his outsized ego as much as for his obvious intelligence, and the post-election jobs he got were out-of-the-way roles at the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission. \u201cI just don\u2019t like the guy,\u201d Bush has said since. The solicitor general role in his home state of Texas, offered to him by Greg Abbott\u2014then the attorney general of Texas, now the governor\u2014was a political lifeline.\n\nFrom the start, it offered a chance to turn his legal acumen into political potential, because it came with a green light to advance conservative aims in the courts. Abbott\u2019s directive for the solicitor general of Texas, Cruz said in his book, was to \u201clook across the country\u201d and \u201cidentify chances to defend conservative principles.\u201d\n\nThis is not the traditional definition of a solicitor general\u2019s job, which comes with two main duties. The first: States get sued, attorneys general and their staffs respond, and some of the cases get appealed\u2014and that\u2019s where the solicitor general comes in, representing the state in higher courts, where the cases are the most legalistic and complex. The second: the writing of amicus briefs in cases elsewhere in which a state believes it has an interest even though it\u2019s not a party.\n\nThe first part can be seen as defense. The second part is more like offense, selectively advancing the interests of the state. The way Cruz did the job? Even the defense was offense, and the interests being asserted were less those of the state than its conservative leaders.\n\n\u201cTexas is a huge state, and there\u2019s plenty of work for the attorney general\u2019s office to do,\u201d said Jim Ho, an attorney in Dallas who succeeded Cruz as solicitor general and is a friend and supporter. Cruz, though, \u201cwas not content to simply do what was asked and go home.\u201d\n\nWhen it came to cases that allowed him to argue for things like the forceful application of the death penalty and expressions of religion in the public arena and against things like abortion and gun control, Ho told me, Cruz \u201cwas on constant watch for opportunities to press a conservative vision of the Constitution.\u201d", "101": "Late last week, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) approved two new strains of genetically engineered potatoes. The potatoes, created by JR Simplot, have been engineered to resist potato blight,... ", "102": "The presidential campaign of Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont filed a lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee on Friday, arguing that the party had unfairly suspended the campaign\u2019s access to key voter information. After several tense hours, both sides announced a deal had been reached.\n\nThe suit came shortly after campaign manager Jeff Weaver acknowledged at a Washington news conference that Sanders staffers had improperly reviewed information gathered by rival Hillary Clinton earlier in the week. But he accused the DNC of over\u00adreacting to the breach by suspending the Sanders campaign\u2019s ability to access the computer system containing information about Democratic-leaning voters, including data the campaign has gathered about its own supporters.\n\nAfter midnight, Sanders and the DNC put out statements that both indicated the impasse had been resolved but that put remarkably different spins on the outcome. Sanders\u2019s campaign said the DNC had \u201ccapitulated\u201d and that Sanders would soon regain access to the data. The DNC said what happened was \u201ccompletely unacceptable\u201d and that it would continue to investigate the circumstances even as Sanders regained access to the valuable information.\n\nWithout a quick resolution, the messy public brawl threatened to overshadow Saturday\u2019s third Democratic presidential debate and cast doubt on the DNC\u2019s ability to manage the sophisticated data tools necessary for the party to win the White House next year. And it sparked significant suspicions among Sanders supporters that the party was conspiring to give a boost to Clinton.\n\nDNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz rejected that allegation Friday, alleging that Sanders staffers had exploited a software error to essentially \u201csteal\u201d data from Clinton\u2019s campaign. Wasserman Schultz said the party would not allow Sanders access to the critical database again until his campaign agreed to an independent audit of what happened.\n\nThe suit, filed in federal court in Washington, argued that under a contract between the DNC and the campaign governing the data system\u2019s use, formal notice in writing is required if either side believes the other has violated the deal. In addition, each side is supposed to be allowed 10 days to address any concerns, the suit said.\n\n\u201cThe DNC may not suspend the Campaign\u2019s access to critical Voter Data out of haste or desperation to clean up after the DNC\u2019s own mistakes,\u201d the suit says.\n\nThe voter data is heavily used to raise money, and the Sanders campaign estimated that it is losing $600,000 a day in \u201ccritical fundraising and publicity opportunities\u201d without access to the files.\n\nThe incident strained the relationship between the campaign of an upstart Vermont senator who until this year has run as an independent and a national party his supporters have long accused of favoring Clinton.\n\nWeaver accused the party of purposely sabotaging Sanders by refusing to restore access to the voter information.\n\n\u201cBy their action, the leadership of the Democratic National Committee is now actively attempting to undermine our campaign,\u201d Weaver said. \u201cI think if you look at the pattern of conduct .\u2009.\u2009. it looks like in this case they\u2019re trying to help the Clinton campaign.\u201d\n\nNGP-VAN, the computer vendor that provides Democrats with detailed information about voters, has said that a computer error on Wednesday briefly allowed the campaigns to review information that had been gathered by their rivals.\n\nThe company maintains a master voter list for the DNC and rents it to national and state campaigns, which then add their own, proprietary information gathered by field workers and volunteers. Firewalls are supposed to prevent campaigns from viewing data gathered by rival campaigns.\n\nThe Sanders campaign has acknowledged that several of its staffers probed the system during the time of the error cited by NGP-VAN. One operative, data director Josh Uretsky, was fired as a result of the incident. Weaver said the actions of several others are being reviewed.\n\nLanding at the airport in Manchester, N.H., ahead of Saturday\u2019s debate, Wasserman Schultz said that Sanders himself was unaware of the breach until she called to discuss it 24 hours after it took place. \u201cHe was stunned,\u201d she said. \u201cI know that Sen. Sanders had absolutely nothing to do with this. .\u2009.\u2009. Unfortunately, he has staff who acted inappropriately, and they need to be held accountable.\u201d\n\nThe severity of the data breach itself remained an issue of serious dispute Friday.\n\nAudit data from NGP-VAN and provided to The Washington Post by the Clinton campaign showed that four Sanders staffers conducted 24 separate searches of Clinton data during a 40-minute window Wednesday, targeting early voting states and searching for lists of voters most and least likely to support Clinton. The logs show that in some cases, the staffers saved the search results in new folders created within the system.\n\n\u201cThis was a very egregious breach and our data was stolen. This was not an inadvertent glimpse into our data,\u201d Clinton\u2019s campaign manager, Robby Mook, told reporters.\n\nOn CNN, Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon accused the Sanders staffers of acting \u201clike kids in the candy store.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey went hog wild, downloading as much data as they could,\u201d he said.\n\nLater Friday, the Clinton camp struck a more conciliatory tone, issuing a statement in which Fallon said that his campaign was hopeful the matter would be resolved Friday night and that the Sanders team would get access to its voter files \u201cright away.\u201d\n\nUretsky told The Post that he and the others conducted the searches of Clinton data after they discovered the software glitch only in an effort to discover the extent of their own data exposure. \u201cWe intentionally did it in a way that was trackable and traceable so that when they did an audit they would be able to see exactly what we did,\u201d he said.\n\nUretsky said there was no attempt to take Clinton information out of the software system.\n\nWeaver blamed the software vendor for the breach, which allowed all campaigns to access one another\u2019s data for a time, insisting that the Sanders campaign had actually quietly alerted the DNC to problems with another vendor system in October.\n\nIn the lawsuit, the campaign argued that a \u201csimilar security incident\u201d during the 2008 presidential campaign resulted in \u201cunintentional transmission of confidential information\u201d to Clinton\u2019s unsuccessful presidential campaign against Barack Obama.\n\nWeaver said a tick-tock provided to the Sanders campaign by the computer vendor confirmed that staffers were not attempting to remove significant Clinton data from the system.\n\n\u201cWe are running a clean campaign,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t need dirty tricks.\u201d\n\nEven before this week, Sanders backers had accused the DNC of trying to protect Clinton by limiting the number and prominence of debates \u2014 a narrative that plays into his anti-establishment appeal.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been sabotaging Bernie\u2019s campaign all along,\u201d said RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, an 185,000-member union that is backing Sanders.\n\nNews of the data breach broke just as Sanders was enjoying a fresh burst of momentum after months in which his campaign appeared to have stalled.\n\nOn Thursday, Sanders received his biggest union endorsement to date, from the 700,000-member Communications Workers of America. He also was endorsed by Democracy for America, a progressive group that claims 1\u00a0million members nationwide. That group, founded by former Vermont governor Howard Dean, who is backing Clinton, said it had surveyed its membership and found 88 percent favored endorsing Sanders.\n\nSanders, who has raised most of his money from small donors over the Internet, also this week celebrated a fundraising milestone: more than 2 million contributions to his campaign. That figure made him competitive with the effort of President Obama\u2019s 2012 re-election effort during the same stretch.", "103": "Recent debates over US government spying have focused on one specific program: the National Security Agency's bulk collection of Americans' telephone records \u2014 and the Patriot Act provision that supplied the program's legal justification. From that perspective, the partial expiration of the Patriot Act a week ago and the subsequent passage of surveillance reform legislation might seem like a decisive victory against mass surveillance.\n\nBut the surveillance debate is actually a lot bigger than the phone records program and the Patriot Act. The NSA has other spying programs with other legal foundations. And the USA Freedom Act, which President Obama signed on Tuesday, doesn't do anything to rein them in.\n\nOn Friday, I talked to John Napier Tye, a former State Department official who resigned last year over what he regards as unconstitutional surveillance by the US federal government. He sees the USA Freedom Act as \"a small step in the right direction,\" but he's hoping the next step will be a broader debate about other ways the US government spies on innocent Americans.\n\nMost people have heard about the Patriot Act, which was signed just weeks after the 9/11 attacks, and was reformed this week by the USA Freedom Act. But Tye argues the real action is elsewhere.\n\n\"You have to keep in mind that most NSA collection on Americans was not under the Patriot Act. It was under other legal authorities. And none of that surveillance is affected by this new law,\" he says. \"When you think about all the collection that the NSA has been doing on Americans, a small percentage \u2014 5 or 10 percent, maybe less \u2014 was under the Patriot Act.\"\n\nTye points to two other sources of authority for government spying. One is the 2008 FISA Amendments Act, which is the legal basis for a controversial NSA program called PRISM that collects private data from major internet companies like Google and Facebook. The other is Executive Order 12333, a Reagan-era directive that has become the basis for a lot of NSA spying.\n\nTye says that EO 12333 is \"an executive order, it's not a statute. It was never passed by Congress. It was originally issued by President Reagan in 1981 and has been amended several times since then \u2014 including by George W. Bush.\"\n\nA huge amount of our data is collected: Gmails and Yahoo messages, Facebook messages, Apple iMessages\n\nEO 12333 \"gives a very broad grant of authority to intelligence agencies to do all kinds of things,\" Tye says. \"There's one section in there that allows the NSA to collect data on US persons as part of a lawful foreign intelligence investigation. That provision is being used to collect a huge amount of Americans' communications and data.\"\n\nWhen the government collects information overseas, it isn't bound by most US surveillance laws. The NSA has reserved the right to \"incidentally\" collect Americans' private communications overseas so long as Americans are not the target of a particular surveillance effort. But Tye argues that this is a huge loophole in practice.\n\n\"I don't think most Americans understand that almost all of their internet and phone data is either stored on backup servers overseas or transits outside of our borders,\" he says. \"A huge amount of our data is collected under this authority outside the borders of the US \u2014 Gmails and Yahoo messages, Facebook messages, Apple iMessages, Twitter, every service you can think of.\"\n\nTye says he has firsthand knowledge of the extent of NSA spying programs. That's because he was an official in the State Department's Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor in 2013 when Edward Snowden's revelations became public.\n\n\"My jobs was internet freedom, promoting free and open internet around the world,\" Tye says. \"When the Snowden leaks happened in June of 2013, I was not surprised. I knew that a lot of stuff had been happening. I knew that a lot of surveillance was going on that no one knew about. And it didn't surprise me that this was finally front-page news.\"\n\nCongress should take a more active role in overseeing executive branch activity\n\nTye says that after the Snowden leaks, \"part of my job was to help develop responses to initiatives within the UN Human Rights Council and the UN General Assembly by Germany, Brazil, and other countries that were very concerned with online privacy. To be able to properly negotiate those efforts, I was briefed on the scope of US intelligence practices. In two different classified briefings, one in the fall of 2013 and one in the first part of 2014, I learned about activities under 12333.\"\n\nTye believed these programs were unconstitutional and began filing complaints inside the government about them. He met with the intelligence committees in both the House and the Senate and filed complaints with the inspectors general of both the State Department and the National Security Agency. He says none of them were very interested in the issue.\n\nSo last summer, Tye quit his job and went public with his concerns in an op-ed for the Washington Post. He says he ran the op-ed through government censors to make sure it didn't disclose any classified information. Tye has spent the last year at the public interest group Avaaz and is now starting his own law firm that will focus on civil rights and human rights issues.\n\nTye would like President Obama to unilaterally revise Executive Order 12333 to better protect the privacy of Americans. If Obama doesn't, Tye would like Congress to hold hearings on the issue. \"I think that Congress should take a more active role in overseeing executive branch activity under 12333,\" Tye says. \"Congress should hold hearings and find out what protections really exist for Americans and how much our data is being collected.\"\n\nHe also favors reforms to the FISA Amendments Act, which was passed by Congress in 2008. Whereas some provisions of the Patriot Act were set to expire this year \u2014 and have now been renewed until 2019 \u2014 the FISA Amendments Act is permanent. The most controversial part of the FISA Amendments Act is Section 702, which allows warrantless surveillance to collect Americans' communications so long as the target is a foreigner located overseas.\n\n\"Under Section 702, the NSA is collecting a lot of stuff inside the United States that's nominally targeting foreigners but in fact is scooping up innocent communications from hundreds of millions of Americans,\" Tye says. Even worse, \"the FBI has access to that database and can search it for domestic criminal reasons. So the purpose of the law nominally was to allow the NSA to conduct foreign intelligence investigations. But as it's currently being used, the FBI is using this data for domestic criminal investigations. The protections that we normally want in place for domestic criminal investigations are not necessarily there.\"", "104": "The FBI has expanded its probe of Hillary Clinton's emails, with agents exploring whether multiple statements violate a federal false statements statute, according to intelligence sources familiar with the ongoing case.\n\nFox News is told agents are looking at U.S. Code 18, Section 1001, which pertains to \"materially false\" statements given either in writing, orally or through a third party. Violations also include pressuring a third party to conspire in a cover-up. Each felony violation is subject to five years in prison.\n\nThis phase represents an expansion of the FBI probe, which is also exploring potential violations of an Espionage Act provision relating to \"gross negligence\" in the handling of national defense information.\n\n\"The agents involved are under a lot of pressure and are busting a--,\" an intelligence source, who was not authorized to speak on the record, told Fox News.\n\nThe section of the criminal code being explored is known as \"statements or entries generally,\" and can be applied when an individual makes misleading or false statements causing federal agents to expend additional resources and time. In this case, legal experts as well as a former FBI agent said, Section 1001 could apply if Clinton, her aides or attorney were not forthcoming with FBI agents about her emails, classification and whether only non-government records were destroyed. It is not publicly known who may have been interviewed.\n\nFox News judicial analyst Judge Andrew Napolitano said the same section got Martha Stewart in trouble with the FBI. To be a violation, the statements do not need to be given under oath.\n\n\"This is a broad, brush statute that punishes individuals who are not direct and fulsome in their answers,\" former FBI intelligence officer Timothy Gill told Fox News. Gill is not connected to the email investigation, but spent 16 years as part of the bureau's national security branch, and worked the post 9/11 anthrax case where considerable time was spent resolving discrepancies in Bruce Ivins' statements and his unusual work activities at Fort Detrick, Md.\n\n\"It is a cover-all. The problem for a defendant is when their statements cause the bureau to expend more time, energy, resources to de-conflict their statements with the evidence,\" he said.\n\nSeparately, two U.S. government officials told Fox News that the FBI is doing its own classification review of the Clinton emails, effectively cutting out what has become a grinding process at the State Department. Under Secretary for Management Patrick Kennedy has argued to both Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and Congress that the \"Top Secret\" emails on Clinton's server could have been pulled from unclassified sources including news reports.\n\n\"You want to go right to the source,\" Gill said. \"Go to the originating, not the collateral, authority. Investigative protocol would demand that.\"\n\nOn Friday, Clapper spokesman Brian Hale confirmed that no change has been made to the two \"Top Secrets\" emails after a Politico report said the intelligence community was retreating from the finding.\n\n\"ODNI has made no such determination and the review is ongoing,\" Hale said. Andrea G. Williams, spokeswoman for the intelligence community inspector general, said she had the same information. Kennedy is seeking an appeal, but no one can explain what statute or executive order would give Clapper that authority.\n\nA U.S. government official who was not authorized to speak on the record said the FBI is identifying suspect emails, and then going directly to the agencies who originated them and therefore own the intelligence -- and who, under the regulations, have final say on the classification.\n\nAs Fox News previously reported, at least four classified Clinton emails had their markings changed to a category that shields the content from Congress and the public, in what State Department whistleblowers believed to be an effort to hide the true extent of classified information on the former secretary of state's server.\n\nOne State Department lawyer involved in the alleged re-categorization was Kate Duval. Duval once worked in the same law firm as Clinton's current and long-time lawyer David Kendall and at the IRS during the Lois Lerner email controversy.

The latest CNN Poll of Polls showed Johnson at 9% support nationwide.\n\nIn a race where the majority of voters say they are dissatisfied with their mainstream offerings for president, where the Republican nominee has secured little support from the nation's largest generation -- millennials -- and where digital media has taken an unprecedented place in the political landscape, here's what Johnson is -- and isn't -- doing to make his long shot candidacy a viable bet.\n\nHunter called the constant interviews \"a critical\" component of the campaign, and after taking scheduling into account, \"We take every opportunity we get.\"\n\nSimilar to Trump, Johnson and his running mate, Bill Weld, have relied on \"earned media\" in the form of appearances in the press.\n\nUnlike Trump, the two almost always stay on message.\n\nSince winning the nomination at the Libertarian Party's convention in May, Johnson and Weld, a former Massachusetts governor, have used their appearances to cast themselves as the centrist candidates between Trump and Hillary Clinton.\n\nThey point out their experience as Republican governors in traditionally Democratic-leaning states. Johnson often touts his laissez-faire approach to drugs and immigration, while Weld has pointed to his record on LGBT rights and his cordial relationship with both sides of the aisle, including the Clintons. Both champion their conservative credos on matters of spending.\n\nBut the live television appearances, including two prime-time town hall events on CNN, have not yet afforded the Libertarian ticket national recognition or a strong showing in the polls.\n\nOn the digital side, the Johnson campaign has largely stuck to its roots by embracing the Libertarian community online. Reaching supporters through social media and email, the campaign has kept its base abreast of its progress -- and appealed for funds.\n\nThe Johnson campaign said Tuesday its August \"money bomb\" fundraising campaign surpassed its goal of $1.5 million based off \"entirely digital\" appeals for money. The campaign said it raised $840,000 on Monday alone, totaling $2.9 million in donations in the first two weeks of the month.\n\nA number of groups have fallen into place doing some of the heavy lifting that the long shot bid needs doing.\n\nAmong the most standout recent entries into the Johnson orbit is a newly minted group called Republicans for Johnson/Weld. The group formed this month to bring the GOP leaders and voters Trump had alienated into the Libertarian fold.\n\nRepublican strategist and group spokesperson Liz Mair told CNN Monday the pro-Johnson forces seeking to convert Republicans from a divisive nominee were in uncharted waters.\n\n\"I don't think anybody's tried to launch an effort like this,\" Mair said.\n\nDespite the lack of an established path, Johnson has notched a few victories. Rep. Scott Rigell said he will support Johnson in November, and Reps. Reid Ribble and Mike Coffman have said they are considering it.\n\nIn separate interviews, Hunter and Mair both said they had heard supportive words from Republican politicians but that many were not ready to come out into the open against their party.\n\nThe outside group could be a key factor in the mainstreaming of Johnson. It already holds several well-known Republican staffers. On Monday, it added Joseph Russo III, a former Sarah Palin aide, Mair said.\n\nGiven the nature of the group, Mair said a \"number of us have better connections\" to GOP Capitol Hill figures than the Libertarian campaign.\n\nWhat will Mitt Romney do?\n\nWithin the Johnson campaign, Weld has taken the lead on outreach to Republicans. However, his biggest prize still eludes him: 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney.\n\nRomney served as governor of Massachusetts after Weld and has said if Weld were topping the ticket, he would be supporting them, but he still needed to hear what Johnson had to say. Months have passed since then without a Romney endorsement.\n\nThe Libertarian efforts to sway Republicans have also had to push back against the notion they are helping Clinton.\n\nJohnson has said he is pulling about evenly from both sides and been forceful in his condemnation of Trump.\n\nMair said Trump was doing the work of helping Clinton on his own and that Clinton's win was at this point \"overwhelming likely,\" although Johnson still had a chance in an unpredictable cycle.\n\n\"The Republicans screwed up. That's not Gary Johnson's fault,\" she said.\n\nUp in the air\n\nHunter said many people would not come to their side until the Johnson candidacy had reached a \"critical mass,\" which they hope to achieve by ramping up their campaign efforts and their ad spending.\n\nIn addition to television ads, the campaign said it was looking at radio, billboards and continuing its online efforts.\n\nAs with the major party candidates, outside spending groups have also taken it upon themselves to launch ads in support of Johnson. A Libertarian spending group called Americans Deserve Better PAC has put together a few spots hailing the former governors as the \"adults\" in the race.\n\nRepublicans for Johnson/Weld, meanwhile, said its focus is less on traditional advertising than generating viral content. So far, however, one of the group's most viral moments came not from distributed content, but from an appearance on CNN. Ahead of the second Libertarian town hall, Mair told CNN's Anderson Cooper that Trump's message \"is being a loud-mouthed d---, basically.\"\n\nAll told, this third party effort has so far expounded more resources on general election advertisements than Trump's campaign, which has yet to join in the air wars.\n\nAll of these efforts have so far been dwarfed by Clinton and her allied super PACs, which have spent exponentially more than the three other presidential campaigns.\n\nJohnson has not been able to draw the kind of rock star crowd sizes that Trump or Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders attracted earlier this year.\n\nThe former New Mexico governor held one rally in Utah on a Saturday earlier this month and another in Reno, Nevada. After rescheduling, he is set to hold another in Albuquerque, New Mexico, this Saturday.\n\nHis campaign said it was still working out specifics on other rallies in the near future but that it planned to host public events soon in Florida and New England.\n\nMeanwhile, fundraising efforts have come largely from the digital side, although the campaign said the governors have appealed directly for funds, with a planned event in Miami on Wednesday.\n\nTheir most prominent fundraising event so far came in late July at a Hollywood event hosted by Drew Carey, the Libertarian host of \"The Price is Right.\"", "106": " ", "107": "Report Copyright Violation nuclear weapons question Hello all.. I have been a longtime lurker on this board but this is my first time posting. I have many questions that I'm hoping someone can help me with since you all seem to be very knowledgeable in this area..In terms of nuclear weapons I know we have tested over 1000 and I know the radiation has increased cases of cancer and killed livestock but shouldn't there be more of an impact? I know the theory with nuclear war ending life as we know it derives from the fact that it would cause a nuclear winter there for beginning some sort of ice age on earth.. with all the weapons that have been tested should we not have already brought ourselves to this or does it more have to do with all weapons going off all at once? Another question being I heard that radiation dissipates quickly (with the most dangerous time being the first 48 hours) if so then how would it cause a nuclear winter? I know these are silly questions I am pretty bad with science so I am hoping someone can explain better.Another question.. I am very sure this article has been linked here before but wondering if someone can give me their thoughts and either disprove the article or explain why it's true. [ link to heiwaco.tripod.com ] Personally I find it's safer to believe they work, if a crazy person threatens you saying they have a gun you take it for face value. You don't want to question them about it or dare them to prove it!In terms of world 3... have all biblical prophecies been fulfilled already to believe world war 3 is next on the timeline? I would be lying if I said I'm not scared. When it comes to death. .it sucks sure but I'm not afraid for myself.. I'm afraid for my one year old! I will do ANYTHING to protect her even if it means giving up my life so she can have a beautiful, healthy, long life! I do believe in God and I find myself turning a lot to him these last few days but I can't help but be angry and feel so guilty bringing this beautiful soul into this world.. for what? So she can suffer and die before she even turns 3? I just feel so lost and hurt. If anyone can give me advice or guidance I would appreciate it more than you know. The aspect of the end being at our door isn't too much a problem for me.. it's more the aspect that I don't want this for my child! I want her to live her life! Fall in love! See the world!I don't know.. maybe the time isn't here.. we've been close to a nuclear war once before maybe just maybe we can dodge this again. Page 1", "108": "\u201cWE ARE THE FUTURE.\u201d \u2014 Kevin MacDonald \nThis is an amazing victory. The stars were aligned. First, the very long shot of Trump being nominated. Then he gets to run against the most corrupt, least charismatic candidate in history (I think Joe Biden would have beaten Trump, and maybe even Bernie Sanders) at a time when Americans naturally want change after 8 years of Obama. \nFundamentally, it is a victory of White Americans over the oligarchic, hostile elites what have run this country for decades. Trump accomplished a hostile takeover of the Republican Party and won without the support or with only lukewarm and vacillating support from much of the GOP elite. \nIn May of 2015 I was very despondent about our prospects. It just didn\u2019t seem like we could break through the elite consensus dominating all the high ground\u2014and all the moral high ground\u2014of the U.S., including the media (print, television, and the Hollywood movie industry), the academic world, politics, Wall St., and the CEOs of major corporations. We were systematically shut out and it was obvious that the powers that be were not going to let the Alt Right get a seat at the table. Then Trump announced, it was hard to take it seriously, but his comments on immigration, American nationalism, political correctness and trade certainly struck a chord. My immediate reaction (July 10, 2015), however, was that he had two things going for him that were absolutely unique \u2014 he is a celebrity and he is very, very rich (\u201c How it could happen \u201c). Such a person is in a position to be heard; he can\u2019t be shut out of the media, and he doesn\u2019t need the money of the corrupt donor class. In fact, the media, eager for ratings, gave him countless opportunities to get his message out. Anyone on the Alt Right could have said the exact same things, but we would be speaking into our closets. \nEven back in July of 2015, it was obvious Trump was not your usual GOP candidate: \n[Trump] certainly did not fall in my estimation when he attacked two prominent operatives of the Republican Party/Israel Lobby nexus hostile to his candidacy, Charles Krauthammer and Jonah Goldberg. Then there\u2019s the Twitter incident : \u201cI promise you that I\u2019m much smarter than Jonathan Leibowitz \u2014 I mean Jon Stewart @TheDailyShow,\u201d tweeted Trump , adding, \u201cWho, by the way, is totally overrated.\u201d It is, of course, considered \u201canti-Semitic\u201d to ever call attention to the fact that someone is Jewish because of the absolutely outrageous suggestion that the Jewish identity of someone like Stewart/Leibowitz might influence his opinions. As we all know, Jews are just like everybody else. \nAnd it quickly turned out that he understood the anger in White America far better than anyone else and he was willing to say what they wanted to hear \u2014 most of all the White working class (72-23!), but also White women(53-43), and his deficit among White educated women was only 51-45 ( CBS exit polls ). Looks like quite a few college-educated women ignored what they heard in their gender studies courses and those mandatory credits in Black Studies. \nWhile obviously a lot of work needs to be done, this is a glorious day. \nThe following is an expanded version of my article in Radix Journal\u2019s series on the meaning of Trump. \nThe Alt Right has gravitated to Trump\u2019s candidacy, and for good reason. Much of what the Alt Right wants will be difficult or impossible to bring about even with a president who is entirely on board with the idea that America should start thinking about the interests of its traditional White majority. But win or lose, Trump has already had a huge effect on American politics in a way that benefits the Alt Right, and his victory will be even more so: Trump has made statements on immigration that have been banned from polite society for 50 years \u2014 deport illegals, seal the border, end birthright citizenship, place a moratorium on Muslim immigration, and make immigration serve actual labor needs rather than a moral imperative (ideally with guest workers not given citizenship). He has deplored Angela Merkel\u2019s policies in Germany and has made statements indicating he opposes the transformation of Western societies via immigration and multiculturalism (\u201c Paris isn\u2019t Paris anymore .\u201d) Trump\u2019s victory will encourage and energize the right in Europe. It is Brexit on steroids \u2014 a scream by voters to stop the way things are going. To stop the destruction of their traditional ways of life. If nothing else, it is throwing a monkey wrench into the system. Tear it down! We can\u2019t keep going on like this! Voters want an end to meaningless wars, an end to importing people who hate us and will never assimilate to our way of life. Trump has unmasked the neocons. The neocons have dominated the intellectual and foreign policy establishment of the Republican Party since the 1980s. From the beginning of Trump\u2019s candidacy, neocons have been leading the #NeverTrump movement, despite the catastrophic effects of a Hillary Clinton presidency on the GOP. A Clinton presidency would ensure a liberal/left voting majority into the foreseeable future given that she would amnesty millions of illegals and dramatically raise total numbers of immigrants and refugees. Clinton Supreme Court appointments would likely gut the First Amendment by enabling \u201chate speech\u201d laws and they would gut the Second Amendment as well. No one on the right, from traditional \u201climited government\u201d conservatives to the Alt Right, would want this, and it\u2019s difficult to believe that the Jewish identities and pro-Israel commitments of the most important neocons are lost on non-Jewish Republicans. The treason of the neocons will be long remembered in GOP circles and will compromise their influence in the future. \nI notice on Twitter that Bill Kristol says that the #NeverTrumpers should be magnanimous in losing, but I would be shocked if neocons were given any role in the GOP. This is Trump\u2019s party now. It is incredibly heartening that he wants a good relationship with Russia at a time when neocons and NATO have been clamoring for confrontation and aggression. It is incredibly heartening that he supports the legitimate Assad government in Syria. I have no doubt that he will act in concert with Russia to end the rebellion and bring peace and stability to the region. Trump has highlighted the chasm between the overwhelmingly White Republican voting base and the GOP donor class intent on globalist policies of mass immigration, free trade, and a bellicose pro-Israel, anti-Russian foreign policy. The pre-Trump GOP was dominated by a neocon foreign policy establishment and a pro-Chamber of Commerce, pro-big business economic policy. This party did not represent the interests of GOP voters and can\u2019t be resurrected. Even if Trump had lost, his energized supporters would be a new and important force within the GOP. His victory will ensure that the GOP will be a populist party for the foreseeable future. Trump has unmasked the media. The media have always been liberal, but this time around, even much of the usual pro-Republican media has been hostile to Trump, and a survey by the Media Research Center found an astounding 91% of media coverage hostile to his candidacy. Who can forget the hostility from mainstream conservative media like National Review , The Weekly Standard , and other neocon outlets? This feeds into the narrative that there has been a unified establishment from the far left to the neoconservative right that has opposed Trump\u2019s populist policies favoring the middle class and the traditional White majority. \nThe media is a pillar of the establishment, and it is heartening indeed that people ignored the deluge of talk of Trump being a racist, a bigot, and a misogynist. The media is a huge loser in Trump\u2019s victory. \nAs we have commented many times, the media is under very powerful Jewish influence. Trump\u2019s victory is a blow to the entire Jewish power structure. I have written 6 articles on Jewish hostility toward Trump, much of this hostility bordering on the clinically paranoid. Jews understand that they do indeed have a great deal of power in the U.S. and throughout the West and that they have used that power to destroy the traditional homogeneity of these societies and to do all they can to make Whites minorities in societies they have dominated for hundreds and, in the case of Europe, many thousands of years. We are a long way from really putting a dent in that power structure, but Trump\u2019s victory is a great first step. Trump has put the Alt Right on the map. There have been numerous articles and commentary on the Alt Right because of Trump\u2019s candidacy. The Alt Right has been the only identifiable intellectual perspective supporting Trump, although we understand that he is not one of us and would not attempt to do much what we would like to see in our ideal world. We are the only intellectual perspective that takes race seriously and accepts the social science research not only on race but on the disastrous costs of imposed multiculturalism for White majorities and the horrifying future awaiting Whites if indeed they do become hated, despised minorities. Traditional conservative intellectuals simply cannot explain what is happening with their usual intellectual toolkit. They can\u2019t explain the anger and the very legitimate fears of the White majority. They can\u2019t understand the racialization of politics. We understand it and are able to analyze it in very sophisticated ways that are entirely within the scientific mainstream. \nMuch of the media coverage of the Alt Right was motivated by attempting to tar Trump as a \u201cracist,\u201d and after the election, win or lose, the media will likely attempt to put the toothpaste back in the tube by ceasing coverage. However, a Trump victory makes that all but impossible. Our increased visibility has meant a very large surge in support for the Alt Right. Meeting attendance is way up, and readership on Alt Right sites is skyrocketing. The future is bright, and a very large amount of the credit for that has to go to Donald Trump. \nWe are the future.", "109": "Erin Brockovich: Millions of Americans' tap water posioned due to EPA standards About the author: Mike Adams (aka the \" Health Ranger \") is a best selling author (#1 best selling science book on Amazon.com) and a globally recognized scientific researcher in clean foods.

It appears party leaders have no authority to sideline Clinton, meaning the special meeting would kick in only if she were to step aside voluntarily. The nominee and her aides say she's recovering and feeling much better now.\n\nBut after Clinton left a 9/11 memorial Sunday stumbling and being helped into an SUV by multiple aides -- an incident the campaign tied to a recent pneumonia diagnosis and other factors -- some Democrats are at least thinking about that process.\n\nFormer DNC Chairman Don Fowler told Politico that the party needs to develop a plan immediately for finding a potential successor candidate.\n\nFormer Al Jazeera and MSNBC anchor David Shuster tweeted Sunday that the DNC was considering an \u201cemergency meeting\u201d to talk about a Clinton replacement, although his source emphasized her status as nominee was up to her, not the party.\n\nNPR\u2019s Cokie Roberts said Monday that Democrats already are considering another candidate.\n\n\u201cIt has them very nervously beginning to whisper about having her step aside and finding another candidate,\u201d Roberts said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s unlikely to be a real thing\u201d and describing the talk as likely \u201can overreaction.\u201d\n\nPerhaps inadvertently feeding that frenzy, former Ohio Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland introduced Clinton running mate Tim Kaine at an event Monday by describing him as \u201cready to become the president\u201d if necessary,\u00a0The Columbus Dispatch\u00a0reported.\n\nBut in the, albeit unlikely, scenario of a replacement scramble, Kaine isn\u2019t necessarily a shoo-in.\n\nVermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and others could all be possible candidates.\n\nHistorian Doug Wead told Fox News\u2019 Neil Cavuto that the votes would tend to go toward whomever the top of the ticket endorses, though it\u2019s not guaranteed.\n\n\u201cWhatever [Clinton] says will likely hold sway, but legally, technically they have their own vote,\u201d he said.\n\nReplacing a member of a major-party ticket would be exceedingly rare, though not unprecedented. This happened in 1972 when Democratic nominee George McGovern\u2019s running mate -- Sen. Thomas Eagleton -- withdrew from the race in July after it was revealed he had undergone electric shock treatment for mental health issues.\n\nEagleton was replaced in August by Sargent Shriver as the new vice presidential nominee. The McGovern/Shriver ticket went on to lose the race in a landslide to incumbent President Richard Nixon.\n\nRick Hasen, who runs the\u00a0Election Law Blog, told FoxNews.com that the situation could become significantly more complicated if it were to play out later in the calendar.\n\n\u201cThe more complicated problem would arise if ballots have already been printed, and people would have started voting. There, the Electoral College would come into play, and electors from the party would be expected to vote for the replacement nominee,\u201d Hasen said.\n\nThe first absentee ballots were mailed out in Sept. 9 in North Carolina, and many other states will soon follow. By mid-September the deadlines for both parties to certify candidates for the general election will have passed in every state \u2013 meaning lawsuits might have to be filed to try and get a replacement on the ballot.\n\nThe DNC did not respond to a request for comment from FoxNews.com.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time this election cycle there has been talk of a candidate dropping out. In August, during a particularly rough patch of poll numbers for Trump, some GOP officials were reportedly considering contingency plans in case the Republican nominee dropped out.\n\nAdam Shaw is a Politics Reporter and occasional Opinion writer for FoxNews.com.

At least one alleged attacker is still on the loose.\n\nAnd a key question looms as investigators race to piece together details about the attackers behind Tuesday's deadly bombings in Belgium's capital: Were these men acting alone, or were other members of a terror cell supporting them?\n\nRaids, arrests and forensic analysis are some of the tools investigators are using to get to the bottom of who was behind the attacks in Brussels, which killed 31 people and wounded 270 others.\n\nTwo of the bombers were brothers. And one of the bombers at the airport appears to be a man authorities named as a suspect in the Paris terror attacks.\n\nBut the investigation is far from finished. With at least one suspect on the run, the stakes are high, Belgian counterterrorism official Paul Van Tigchelt said Wednesday.\n\n\"There are still a number of people, possibly involved in the attacks still in our country ... who still pose a threat,\" he said.\n\nHere's a look at the latest developments in the investigation, and the questions they raise.\n\nBelgian federal prosecutor Frederic Van Leeuw identified Ibrahim El Bakraoui as one of two suicide bombers at the Brussels airport and his brother, Khalid El Bakraoui, as the man behind a deadly suicide blast about an hour later on a train near the Maelbeek metro station.\n\nThis isn't the first time they've come across authorities' radar.\n\nIbrahim El Bakraoui was deported by Turkey to the Netherlands last year, a senior Turkish official told CNN. The Turkish presidency's office said authorities there captured him in July 2015 and flagged him to Belgian authorities.\n\nBelgian authorities, the Turkish official said, responded soon after saying he had a criminal record but no known ties to terrorism.\n\n\"These two deceased suicide bombers had lengthy criminal records,\" he said, \"but (were) not linked to terrorism.\"\n\nIbrahim El Bakraoui had been sentenced in October 2010 by a Brussels criminal court to nine years behind bars for opening fire on police officers with a Kalashnikov during a robbery, according to Belgian public broadcaster RTBF and CNN affiliate RTL.\n\nInterpol had issued a \"red notice\" for Khalid El Bakraoui, the subway bomber, that noted Belgian authorities wanted him in connection with terrorism. But it wasn't clear when that notice was issued or why Belgian authorities now say he had no ties to terrorism.\n\nQuestion to consider: If they were already on authorities' radar, how did the brothers manage to slip through the cracks and carry out the deadly attacks?\n\nSurveillance images showing three men pushing luggage carts through the airport have played an important role as authorities work to pinpoint the suspects.\n\nAuthorities say bomber Ibrahim El Bakraoui is the man in the middle. Najim Laachraoui, an ISIS bomb-maker, is the man on the left in the picture, a Belgian counterterrorism official told CNN's Paul Cruickshank.\n\nInvestigators believe both were killed in the airport blast. But authorities are looking for the third man in the photo, walking on the right and wearing light-colored clothing and a hat.\n\nBelgium's interior minister said that man placed a bomb at the airport and left.\n\nWhile two explosives went off within 37 seconds of each other shortly before 8 a.m., this third bomb -- described as the \"heaviest\" by Van Leeuw -- did not, instead being detonated by authorities later in a controlled explosion.\n\nQuestions to consider: Where did the man in light-colored clothing go? Is anyone helping him hide out from authorities, and could he be plotting another attack?\n\nTwo people were arrested in Brussels in connection with the attacks -- one in Schaerbeek and the other in Haren, Van Leeuw said.\n\nOne was released later that day, according to the prosecutor.\n\nAnother person was detained Wednesday, according to Belgian public broadcaster RTBF.\n\nOne raid, officials said, came after a tip from a taxi driver led them to the northeast Brussels area of Schaerbeek.\n\nThe driver recognized the men shown in surveillance footage and told authorities he'd driven the men to the airport before the attacks. Police raided the area where the driver told them he'd picked up the men.\n\nOn Wednesday, they made another significant find: Ibrahim El Bakraoui's will.\n\nPolice found the airport bomber's will on a computer in a trash can in Schaerbeek, Van Leeuw said.\n\nThe will indicated Bakraoui \"needs to rush\" and \"no longer feels safe.\"\n\nQuestions to consider: Who are the people who were arrested, and what was their alleged role in the attacks?\n\nThe latest connection: Laachraoui, a suspect in the Paris attacks who authorities now say they believe was one of the Brussels airport bombers.\n\nInvestigators believe Abdeslam likely planned to be part of an attack orchestrated by the same ISIS cell that carried out Tuesday's attacks, a senior Belgian counterterrorism official told Cruickshank.\n\nThe Brussels attackers likely accelerated their plans when police discovered Abdeslam's hideout, investigators believe.\n\nAnd one of the apartments where he hid before his capture, located in the southern Brussels district of Forest, allegedly has ties to one of the Bakraoui brothers.\n\nQuestions to consider: What role, if any, did Abeslam's arrest play in the Brussels attacks? Are there other links between the Paris and Brussels attacks?\n\nAnother piece of evidence authorities found during the Brussels raids could help in their investigation: unused explosives.\n\nIn the Schaerbeek residence, authorities found 15 kilograms of the explosive TATP and screws among the bomb-making materials there, Van Leeuw said.\n\n\"Such bombs have been a signature of jihadist terrorists in the West for more than a decade because the materials are so easy to acquire, unlike military-grade explosives, which are tightly controlled in much of the West,\" CNN National Security Analyst Peter Bergen said.\n\nTATP-based bombs require technical know-how and bulk purchases of hydrogen peroxide or hair bleach. That helps authorities narrow down potential bomb-making suspects, because making the explosives can sometimes bleach hair. So authorities can identify bomb-makers in part by recognizing unusually bleached hair or asking sellers to report any suspiciously large purchases of hydrogen peroxide.\n\nQuestions to consider: Will the bomb-making materials lead investigators to any new suspects or help them dismantle a terror cell?", "112": "opednews.com - Advertisement - The news in the Guardian (June 18) that 'The government has been secretly awarding honours to senior figures in the US military and foreign businessmen ' shows the importance we Brits attach to honoring people.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n\n(CNN) As the nation was preparing for the July Fourth weekend, there was grim news from San Francisco. On Wednesday night, Kate Steinle , 31, was fatally shot, apparently randomly, while walking with her father on a busy pier. A Mexican immigrant, who CNN reported was in the country without documentation, was arrested in her death.\n\nIllegally re-entering the country after being deported, as Juan Francisco Lopez-Sanchez is said to have done, is a federal felony . He has also been accused of a horrific, violent crime. And according to immigration authorities, he has seven other felony convictions, including four for drug offenses.\n\nBut that doesn't make him a symbol of the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Nor is he the poster boy for out-of-control illegal immigration across our southern border (illegal immigration from Mexico is at a 40-year low). He does not represent the overwhelming majority of immigrants in this country -- legal or otherwise -- who are productive members of society.\n\nLopez-Sanchez is simply a dangerous individual who should not have been free and among us.\n\nIt is a myth that increased illegal immigration leads to more crime. Research from the Immigration Policy Center shows that crime rates fell in the United States as the size of our immigrant population, including undocumented immigrants, grew from 1990 to 2010.\n\nMost undocumented immigrants come to the United States to work and provide a better life for themselves and their families.\n\nConsider that several mass shootings, from Aurora to Newtown to Charleston, were committed by young white men. Does that mean that all young white men are potential mass murderers? Of course not.\n\nThe same news outlets that are now trumpeting Wednesday's murder as proof that undocumented immigrants are criminals often overlook or ignore other stories of undocumented immigrants who are genuine heroes. In 2013, an undocumented immigrant rescued a mother and her child on Staten Island, New York, amidst the storm surge of Superstorm Sandy.\n\nOne takeaway from this episode is that deporting as many undocumented immigrants as possible is not the answer to our immigration problems. Lopez-Sanchez had been deported five times, and yet he was still here in the country without authorization.\n\nBack in 2011, the deputy director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement told an immigration subcommittee of Congress that it costs $12,500 to deport a person. Multiply this by five and that is how much taxpayer money was wasted on a criminal who remained at large to randomly take the life of an innocent young woman.\n\nAnother lesson here is our country does not need more immigration enforcement; our country needs smarter and better immigration enforcement. Up to now, immigration authorities have wasted time, manpower and money chasing after people working productively in their communities as, say, gardeners and maids, while felons like Lopez-Sanchez slipped through the cracks.\n\nThat's why it was good news last week that the Department of Homeland Security announced it is rethinking its deportation priorities to focus on recent arrivals and serious criminals.\n\nThis move is a step in the right direction, because it is time to start seriously targeting those immigrants who are a real threat to public safety. The government will be focusing its enforcement efforts on three categories of people: convicted criminals, recent border crossers and terrorism threats.\n\nTrue, Lopez-Sanchez should not have been in the country, or he should have at least been behind bars. But Immigration and Customs Enforcement erred in not seeking a warrant or court order for his arrest and he was released in accordance with city law in March.\n\nWhat's more, President Barack Obama's proposed executive action on immigration, currently tied up in a legal battle, might also have made a difference because it would have freed up resources to go after people like Lopez-Sanchez.\n\nAlthough Steinle's death was a tragedy, it was the alleged action of one man. All undocumented immigrants do not deserve to be vilified by false association.", "116": "Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday said he would not allow Israel to be \"submerged\" by refugees after calls for the Jewish state to take in those fleeing Syria's war.\n\nSpeaking at the weekly cabinet meeting, Netanyahu also announced the start of construction of a fence along Israel's border with Jordan, according to his office.\n\n\"We will not allow Israel to be submerged by a wave of illegal migrants and terrorist activists,\" Netanyahu said.\n\n\"Israel is not indifferent to the human tragedy of Syrian and African refugees... but Israel is a small country \u2014 very small \u2014 without demographic or geographic depth. That is why we must control our borders.\"\n\nOpposition leader Isaac Herzog on Saturday said Israel should take in Syrian refugees, recalling the plight of Jews who sought refuge from past conflicts.\n\nPalestinian president Mahmud Abbas also called for Israel to allow Palestinians from refugee camps in Syria to travel to the Palestinian territories, whose external borders are controlled by the Jewish state.\n\nThere is already hostility in Israel toward asylum-seekers from Africa and a concerted government effort to repatriate them.\n\nRights groups say thousands of African asylum seekers have been coerced into \"voluntary\" departures.\n\nOfficial figures show 45,000 illegal immigrants are in Israel, almost all from Eritrea and Sudan. Most of those not in detention live in poor areas of southern Tel Aviv, where there have been several protests against them.\n\nThe start of construction of the 30-kilometer (19-mile) fence announced by Netanyahu involves extension of a security barrier to part of its eastern border with Jordan in a bid to keep out militants and illegal migrants.\n\nNetanyahu said when it was approved in June that the new fence was a continuation of a 240-kilometer barrier built along the Egyptian border which \"blocked the entry of illegal migrants into Israel and the various terrorist movements\".\n\nIn its first stage, the new fence is being built along Israel's eastern border between Eilat and where a new airport will be built in the Timna Valley.\n\n\"We will continue the fence up to the Golan Heights,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nThat would take it into the Israeli-occupied West Bank along the Jordan Valley, an area which is already under Israeli military control but is claimed by the Palestinians as part of their state.\n\nIsrael has insisted on maintaining troops in the area in any final peace agreement, a stance completely rejected by the Palestinians who say it would be a violation of their sovereignty and merely perpetuate the occupation.\n\nIsrael also has a fence that runs along the Syrian frontier through the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.\n\nThose fences are in addition to a barrier that runs through the West Bank, which Israel began building during the second Palestinian intifada, or uprising, which lasted from 2000-2005.\n\nIsrael seized 1,200 square kilometers (460 square miles) of the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Six Day War and annexed it 14 years later, in a move never recognized by the international community.", "117": "APOCALYPSE NOW: Trump Voters Warn Of \u2018Revolution\u2019 If Clinton Wins By Andrew Bradford on October 28, 2016 Subscribe \nThere\u2019s nothing wrong with being passionate when it comes to your political beliefs and the candidate you support. In an electorate as deeply divided as we currently see in this country, you expect no less. But ask yourself this question: If your candidate loses, are you ready to take up arms and try to overthrow the government? For some who ardently support GOP nominee Donald Trump, the answer is a resounding yes. \nTake for example Jared Halbrook, who lives in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and told the New York Times : \u201cPeople are going to march on the capitols. They\u2019re going to do whatever needs to be done to get her out of office, because she does not belong there. \u201cIf push comes to shove, (Clinton) has to go by any means necessary, it will be done.\u201d \nRoger Pillath said he also sees violence on the horizon if Clinton is elected: \u201cIt\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do, but I\u2019m scared that the country is going to go into a riot. I\u2019ve never seen the country so divided, just black and white \u2014 there\u2019s no compromise whatsoever. The Clinton campaign says together we are stronger, but there\u2019s no together. The country has never been so divided. I\u2019m looking at revolution right now.\u201d \nAs Trump continues to talk of the election being \u201crigged,\u201d his words are having an effect on people like Paul Swick, who had this ominous warning: \u201cIf she comes after the guns, it\u2019s going to be a rough, bumpy road.

But sometimes reformation comes through bloodshed.\u201d \nRetired truck driver Alan Weegens envisions a very dark future for the United States and says he\u2019s ready to do whatever is necessary: \u201cI am not going to take my weapon to go out into the streets to protest an election I did not win. But I think that if certain events came about, a person would need to protect themselves, depending on where they lived, when your neighborhood goes up in flames.\u201d \nSee if you can recall the last time we heard this kind of violent talk which led to actions by far right nuts who were inspired to be \u201cheroes\u201d in their own minds.

(ENERGY.GOV via Wikimedia Commons) \nLONDON\u2014The global watchdog responsible for protecting the world \u2019 s wealth of species, the UN \u2019 s Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), has looked at the hopes for reining in climate change through geo-engineering. Its bleak conclusion, echoing that reached by many independent scientists, is that the chances are \u201chighly uncertain\u201d. \u201cNovel means\u201d, in this context, describes trying to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by removing them from the atmosphere, and altering the amount of heat from the Sun that reaches the Earth. Some scientists and policymakers say geo-engineering, as these strategies are collectively known, is essential if the world is to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement . This is because current attempts to reduce emissions cannot make big enough cuts fast enough to keep global average temperatures from rising more than 2\u00b0C above their pre-industrial levels, the Agreement\u2019s basic goal. But the CBD says in a report that geo-engineering, while it could possibly help to prevent the world overheating, might endanger global biodiversity and have other unpredictable effects. Many independent analysts have raised similar concerns.Attempts to increase the amount of carbon in the oceans, in order to remove GHGs, have so far shown disappointing results. One report doubted that geo-engineering could slow sea-level rise . Another said it could not arrest the melting of Arctic ice . A third study found that geo-engineering would make things little better and might even make global warming worse . Transboundary impacts The lead author of the CBD geo-engineering report is a British scientist, Dr Phillip Williamson, of the UK\u2019s Natural Environment Research Council . He is an associate fellow in the School of Environmental Sciences at the University of East Anglia , UK. The CBD originally became involved in climate geo-engineering in 2008, because member governments were concerned that experiments to fertilise the oceans could pose unknown risks to the environment (they were then unregulated when carried out in international waters). The CBD\u2019s concern expanded to include other geo-engineering techniques, especially atmospheric methods which could have uncertain transboundary impacts. Some scientists argue that \u201cgeo-engineering\u201d is a hazily-defined term and prefer to speak instead simply of \u201cgreenhouse gas removal\u201d. Dr Williamson and his colleagues say assessment of the impacts of geo-engineering on biodiversity \u201cis not straightforward and is subject to many uncertainties\u201d. On greenhouse gas removal they warn that removing a given quantity of a greenhouse gas would not fully compensate for an earlier \u2018overshoot\u2019 of emissions. New risks In some cases, they say, the cure may be worse than the disease: \u201cThe large-scale deployment of bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) seems likely to have significant negative impacts on biodiversity through land use change.\u201d When it comes to attempts to reflect sunlight back out into space or to manage solar radiation, a familiar theme recurs: \u201cThere are high levels of uncertainty about the impacts of SRM [solar radiation management] techniques, which could present significant new risks to biodiversity.\u201d Time and again, it seems, a potential advance is liable to be cancelled by an equally likely reverse: if SRM benefits coral reefs by decreasing temperature-induced bleaching (as it may), in certain conditions \u201cit may also increase, indirectly, the impacts of ocean acidification.\u201d There could even be a risk in some circumstances of loss to the Earth\u2019s protective ozone layer. Dr Williamson and his colleagues believe that geo-engineering is essential\u2014if it can be made to work\u2014because of the diminishing chances that anything else will. \u201cI\u2019m sceptical. That\u2019s not to say bio-energy with carbon capture and storage is impossible, but it seems extremely unlikely to be feasible\u201d They write: \u201cIt may still be possible that deep and very rapid decarbonisation by all countries might allow climate change to be kept within a 2\u00b0C limit by emission reduction alone. However, any such window of opportunity is rapidly closing.\u201d Repeatedly, those two words recur: a suggested technique or development will be \u201chighly uncertain\u201d. Most of the report amounts to a very cautious call for more research, coupled with an implicit acceptance that in the end geo-engineering is unlikely to prove capable of contributing much to climate mitigation. Dr Williamson told the Climate News Network: \u201cI\u2019m sceptical. That\u2019s not to say bio-energy with carbon capture and storage is impossible, but it seems extremely unlikely to be feasible (for all sorts of reasons)\u201d at the scale needed. When the CBD member governments meet in December they are expected to call for more research: a safe option in most circumstances, but far from a ringing endorsement of a technology once seen as very promising. \nAlex Kirby is a former BBC journalist and environment correspondent.

The two front-runners \u2014 Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders \u2014 are closer in the polls than ever, and the Iowa caucus is only two weeks away.\n\nUp until now, Clinton has done well in debates; it's a format that suits her. But Sanders' message is breaking through, and he's gaining in the polls nationally, leads in New Hampshire and is neck and neck with Clinton in Iowa. That means the pressure is on for both candidates Sunday night. The debate, taking place in Charleston, S.C., begins at 9 p.m. EST. The NBC/YouTube/Congressional Black Caucus Institute debate will air on NBC broadcast stations and livestreamed on NBC digital platforms, including its YouTube channel.\n\nHere's what the candidates need to do \u2014 and avoid:\n\nNeeds: Show why her plans are pragmatic solutions that work for the progressive base, while still respecting Sanders supporters. She's gotten away from her answer in the first debate that she's \"a progressive who likes to get things done.\" Then again, it's tough to make that argument to primary voters\n\nAvoid: Lawyerly, unclear answers that play into an inauthentic narrative, especially paired against Sanders, whose authenticity has been key; attacks that could be seen as cheap shots, like on health care\n\nNeeds: Convince Democratic voters, who are skeptical he's presidential material, that he can win; show a facility with issues beyond his core message\n\nAvoid: Pulling punches like he's done in past debates\n\nNeeds: Somehow appear relevant; as it is, he barely made it onto the debate stage. His poll numbers had to be rounded up to qualify\n\nAvoid: Being dismissed, especially after the question on the investigation into his discounted purchase of furniture from the governor's office when he left.\n\n1. Where does the race stand? Hillary Clinton seemed to have a comfortable lead on Vermont Independent Bernie Sanders last year, but that has slipped considerably and they are in a neck-and-neck race.\n\nSanders has picked up momentum with his message and his passion \u2014 and Democratic voters like him. He continues to lead in New Hampshire, where he's been in the top spot for the better part of the last five months. He's also closing in Iowa, which is perhaps more surprising, but that's a place where passion counts, because of how the caucuses are conducted.\n\nBeyond the first two states, Clinton still has leads with non-white voters, who are critical to Clinton's \"firewall\" in the South. But that firewall might not look as insurmountable if she loses one or both of these first crucial contests.\n\n2. What about the issues \u2014 what's dividing these two? Sanders has gained steam because of his clear message on Wall Street and income inequality. He's tried to tie Clinton to big financial institutions, and Clinton has struggled in defending those ties, as Sanders has labeled her the \"status quo.\"\n\nLately, it's been health care and guns. Sanders voted for Obamacare, but he prefers a single-payer system; Clinton wants more modest tweaks. It may have been a bad tactic for Clinton's daughter Chelsea to try and go after Sanders from the left and accuse him of wanting to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. Clinton stood by her daughter. Bigger picture: Clinton has criticized Sanders for how to pay all of the reforms he wants. Sanders has not been completely forthcoming on a financial and tax plan, though he promises to explain later.\n\nClinton has harped on Sanders' past support for more moderate gun measures, including his support for a 2005 law that protects gun manufacturers from liability if a gun made by one of them is used in a killing. On Saturday, the day before the debate, Sanders came out in favor of a measure to amend the law.\n\n3. So, with these dividing lines, do they go negative in the debate? There's a risk in going negative, but more so for Clinton. Sanders' voters are very loyal. Clinton is losing ground and can't afford to be completely positive. But how to attack Sanders in a way that resonates and seems authentic will be a challenge. Clinton's making the case she's the more electable \u2014 and certainly most Democratic voters would do anything to make sure a Republican isn't elected, especially Ted Cruz or Donald Trump.", "120": "It is increasingly apparent that the U.S. war against Islamic extremism has been put on hold by President Obama and his national security team.\n\nPresident Obama failed to even mention Al Qaeda during his State of the Union address. In early January, the recent terrorist attacks in Paris against the Charlie Hebdo magazine and a kosher supermarket gave us a glimpse of what the future of terrorism looks like, and what the civilized world will have to defend against.\n\nAt the same time, the unfolding chaos in Yemen and loss of a U.S. partner in the fight against Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) raises serious concerns about the future of a country that four months ago President Obama cited as a successful model for U.S.-led efforts to defeat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL).\n\n\n\n \n\n ISIL and AQAP are two faces of the same enemy, radical violent Islam, which is on the march around the world.\n\nIn 2013, ISIL was confined to Syria and Iraq. As the Syria civil war dragged on, and in the absence of early, forceful intervention on the part of the United States or European nations, the chaotic situation spread to Iraq, where weak security services were no match for an emboldened terrorist army.\n\nIn 2014, global support to the Islamic State blossomed as it began to supplant likeminded terrorist groups, and the Islamic State counted affiliates in Algeria, Libya, Egypt, Saudi Arabia. \u00a0ISIL even has begun to make inroads in Yemen, where the United States has been involved in efforts to degrade AQAP's capabilities, but have been unable to eliminate AQAP's ability to conduct attacks on us and our allies. \u00a0AQAP remains one of the most pressing security threats America currently faces as the recent attacks in Paris show.\n\n \n\n In the wake of the Paris attacks and plots disrupted elsewhere in Europe, European capitals are rightfully defiant in the face of terror. But without a change in our strategy, the task of defending against the triple threat of home grown extremism, jihadists who have easy access to hotbeds of radicalization in places like Yemen and Syria, and the expansion of the Islamic State, will be nearly impossible.\n\n \n\n The Islamic State continues to recruit extremists in Europe, the Middle East, and as far away as southeast Asia, using targeted, high quality videos, magazines and literature copied in several languages to spread their message around the world. \u00a0They trumpet their successes on the battlefield, and try to portray a welcoming environment centered on family and Islam as a means to attract terrorists and their families as subjects of their caliphate.\n\nThe United States and all civilized countries need to coordinate our efforts to fight the Islamic State first by cutting them off. \u00a0We must counter their message on social media; bolster allies like Iraq and Jordan; and ensure that we prevent suspected terrorists from traveling back and forth between their homelands and places like Syria, Libya, and Yemen. \u00a0Perhaps most importantly, we have to help governments eliminate the safe havens that the Islamic State relies on to gather strength. \u00a0\n\n \n\n Syria, Yemen, and Libya are all examples of our failure to learn one of the fundamental lessons of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 -- that failed and failing states breed instability and are potential safe havens for terrorists who will eventually turn their attention toward us.\n\n \n\n We also cannot afford to ignore another lesson of 9/11 and curtail intelligence gathering capabilities that have been legally and painstakingly established following those horrific attacks.\n\nThe U.S. government should implore American technology companies to cooperate with authorities so that we can better track terrorist activity and monitor terrorist communications as we face the increasing challenge of homegrown terrorists radicalized by little more than what they see on the Internet.\n\nThis year, a new Republican majority in both houses of Congress will have to extend current authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, and I urge my colleagues to consider a permanent extension of the counterterrorism tools our intelligence community relies on to keep the American people safe.\n\n \n\n The challenge we face as free societies is unlike anything we have seen in recent decades. \u00a0As we look at this moment in the long war against terrorism, it is encouraging to see Europeans aggressively moving to defend the continent following a horrific attack. \u00a0But one need look no further than the setbacks in Yemen and the stalemate in Syria and Iraq to see the limitations of President Obama's current strategy. \u00a0\n\n \n\n Lofty speeches and half measures do not defeat terrorist groups. \u00a0They also do not keep Americans safe in the long term. \u00a0The threat from Islamic extremism is only growing and without greater leadership from the United States, I fear that it will only be a matter of time before innocent Americans pay the ultimate price if we continue to underestimate our enemies and not develop a strategy that is commensurate to the threat.\n\nRepublican Marco Rubio represents Florida in the U.S. Senate.

He also wants people to continue to speak up about the problems of racial injustice and poverty that persist in American society.\n\n\"It is important to come back to remember Selma,\" Lewis told CNN in an interview at First Baptist Church. \"The vote is powerful. It is the most powerful nonviolent tool we have in a democratic society and I don't want people to forget that people paid a price.\n\n\"Selma, these churches and these people, gave it everything they had. We wouldn't be where we are today as a nation and as a people (if it) hadn't been for this community.\"\n\nChurches -- like Selma's First Baptist and Brown Chapel -- served as important meeting places during the movement, in part because they were run by the black community.\n\nAnd music was vital as a unifying force.\n\n\"Without music, the movement would have been like a bird without wings,\" Lewis said.\n\nHe recalled how people would often sing during the marches, sometimes making up songs along the way.\n\n\"Music helped create a sense of solidarity, and there were people in some communities, in some towns and cities like Selma, saying if the meetings are being held at the church, it must be all right. That's the house of the Lord. They must be doing something that is right.\"\n\nActivists had been working for years in and around Selma trying to help people register to vote. At the time, only 2.1% of blacks in Dallas County were registered, Lewis said. When blacks attempted to register, they were often given impossible tasks, like counting the number of jelly beans in a jar or the number of bubbles on a bar of soap, to complete before being allowed to sign up. Black lawyers, doctors, business people, public school teachers and college professors were told they could not read and write well enough to pass the so-called literacy test.\n\nAs chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, Lewis -- along with many others -- would spill blood to change that, not only as a leader of the Bloody Sunday march but in other confrontations across the South.\n\nLewis was arrested some 40 times during the 1960s as he challenged the segregationist Jim Crow laws that kept blacks oppressed. He spent 44 days imprisoned in Mississippi during the Freedom Rides in 1961. As a student at Fisk University, he organized sit-ins at lunch counters in Nashville, Tennessee, even spending his birthday in jail there in 1961 -- so Lewis was no stranger to run-ins with the law. But the events of Bloody Sunday would prove fateful for the movement.\n\nTelevision cameras and photographers captured the troopers attacking the marchers with night sticks and whips -- one man in the posse even had a rubber hose wrapped with barbed wire, Lewis wrote in his memoir \"Walking with the Wind.\"\n\nThe troopers trampled the crowd with their horses and released nauseating tear gas. The pictures horrified citizens across the country. Eight days after the march, President Lyndon B. Johnson spoke before Congress about voting rights. He signed the Voting Rights Act on Aug. 6 to ensure that all citizens would be able to vote regardless of their skin color.\n\nFive decades later, Lewis said a great deal of progress has been made in the struggle for equality. But he added that, despite having twice elected a black man to the nation's highest office, the country still has a long way to go to become the so-called \"Beloved Community\" Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. envisioned \"where we can lay down the burden of race.\"\n\n\"We have a black president. We've made a lot of progress, but we're not a post-racial society yet,\" he said. \"We still have a distance to go. The scars and stains of racism are still deeply embedded in the American society.\"\n\nThe need for 'righteous indignation'\n\nLewis, who has written a trilogy of graphic novels for young adults about his life called \"March,\" said it was important not to sweep the problems that still plague America under the rug and to instead speak up with a sense of \"righteous indignation.\"\n\n\"You cannot be quiet.

The bipartisan event comes as efforts to update to the Voting Rights Act have stalled in Congress. Still, Lewis is optimistic both parties can come together to fix it.\n\n\"We must do it. It's the right thing to do,\" he said. \"There is a deliberate, systematic effort to take us back. We've made too much progress to go back.\" He was referring to efforts in some states to do away with early voting and voting on Sunday or on weekends and to require photo IDs, moves he said make it harder for young people, seniors and minorities to vote.\n\n\"I'm afraid that if we fail to fix it, many of our fellow citizens will not be able to become participants in the democratic process,\" he concluded.", "123": "We Use Cookies: Our policy [X] \u201cWe Were Long Overdue A Presidential Assassination Anyway\u201d November 9, 2016 - BREAKING NEWS Share 0 Add Comment \nAMERICANS still coming to terms with the surprising outcome of the 2016 US elections have sought solace in the fact that the country was long overdue a presidential assassination anyway. \n\u201cIt\u2019s been what, 50 odd years since the last one?\u201d queried disgruntled Florida native Toby Hartford, \u201cI mean Reagan doesn\u2019t count since he survived it\u201d. \nCiting the perfect societal conditions for a swell in dissatisfaction and disquiet brought on by divisive rhetoric, isolation and amplified fears to fester, much of the American population was in agreement that \u2018yes, an assassination is something that could conceivably happen\u2019. \n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t not celebrate it, were it to happen, which is really fucking depressing when I think about it.

Share on Facebook Share on Twitter \nThose playing along at home probably noticed that the flood of groping and sexual assault allegations against Donald Trump, whether true or false, receded awfully quickly once the media and the Clinton campaign decided to clear the decks for a new batch of think pieces about Trump\u2019s allegations that the election was rigged. \nIn case the public missed the hint that, by questioning the integrity of America\u2019s electoral process, Trump was sowing the seeds of Election Day violence, a new wave of think pieces emerged to make the threat that much more explicit. They\u2019re not saying there\u2019s gonna be violence; they\u2019re just strongly implying there\u2019s gonna be violence.

To appear on stage with Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump this autumn, Gary Johnson needs to boost his national polling numbers to 15% from around 8% now.\n\nWithout that national exposure, and the blockbuster ratings the three scheduled Clinton-Trump dust-ups are likely to produce, it\u2019s hard for anyone to see how Johnson, 63, or either of two other minor-party candidates, the Green party\u2019s Jill Stein or even Evan McMullin, a 40-year-old former CIA counterterrorism officer, could ever become more than mere electoral curiosities.\n\nBut the emergence of three independent candidates, during a year of record dissatisfaction with the major party candidates, may still make for an unpredictable twist to the story. Polling data suggests libertarians on both sides of the political divide are giving independent candidates a second look, and in Las Vegas on Friday, Johnson and Stein spoke before a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Islander voters to press their cases.\n\nSoft-spoken and wearing Nikes, Johnson presented a platform of social libertarianism, fiscal conservatism and non-interventionism in foreign affairs. He argued at the gathering that in this, \u201cthe craziest election of all time\u201d, he had a chance: \u201cI might be the next president of the United States.\u201d\n\nA just-released WSJ-NBC poll gave Johnson 15% in the crucial swing state of Colorado, and Stein 6%. In Las Vegas, he was asked repeatedly if a vote for him or any third-party candidate was somehow wasted.\n\n\u201cA wasted vote is voting for somebody you don\u2019t believe in. That\u2019s a wasted vote,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cVote for the person you believe in \u2013 that\u2019s how you bring about change. I hope after having made my pitch today that you\u2019ll realize, if you want to waste your vote on Clinton or Trump, have at it.\u201d\n\nStein, who spoke separately at the event, similarly argued that many Americans were looking for an alternative to Trump and Hillary Clinton, whom she dubbed as \u201cthe most disliked and untrusted\u201d major-party nominees in US history. \n\n\u201cDemocracy needs a moral compass,\u201d she told a gathering of Asian American and Pacific Island groups. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about who you don\u2019t like the most or who you are most afraid of.\u201d \n\n\n\nStein, who like Johnson represented her party in 2012, has outlined policy positions that include a \u201cGreen New Deal\u201d, focused on renewable energy jobs and aimed at making the United States transition to 100% renewable energy complete by 2030. Stein has also proposed a reduction in the military budget by a third and the creation of a regional food systems based on sustainable organic agriculture.\n\n\n\nOn the Republican side, Evan McMullin, a beneficiary of the grounded \u201cNever Trump\u201d movement, failed to get on the ballot in 26 states before he\u2019d even sent out his first campaign release. McMullin nonetheless tried to give disaffected conservatives an alternative to the Republican nominee who, he says, has tapped into \u201cpeople\u2019s darkest prejudices and deepest fears\u201d.\n\nMcMullin\u2019s best hope \u2013 and likely his only one \u2013 to make an electoral dent would require Trump\u2019s departure from the race, though the nominee has made no overt sign that he wants to quit. \u201cLike millions of Americans, I had hoped this year would bring us better nominees who, despite party differences, could offer compelling visions of a better future,\u201d McMullin said in his announcement.\n\n\u201cInstead, we have been left with two candidates who are fundamentally unfit for the profound responsibilities they seek.\u201d\n\nBut can they begin to make a difference? Only once in recent election cycles have third party candidates had any significant influence, when in 1992, Texan businessman Ross Perot took 18% of the vote, carving into the support for incumbent Republican George HW Bush and helping Arkansas governor Bill Clinton to victory. Some Democrats blamed third-party candidate Ralph Nader for delivering George W Bush the election in 2000, but the third-party candidate won a paltry 2.74% of the vote, and his supporters were split between Republicans and Democrats.\n\nJohnson\u2019s running mate, former Massachusetts governor William Weld, said he\u2019d seen interest and fundraising pick up as Trump\u2019s campaign has floundered. Their campaign recently reported a $1m one-week fundraising haul and has reported that more than 40,000 people have pledged to donate at least $15 to his campaign on 15 August.\n\nBut that was in a relatively tight race. With Clinton now leading Trump by double digits in some key battleground states, the impact of any third-party candidate could be limited.\n\n\u201cAt the moment it doesn\u2019t look like they can have much impact at all,\u201d said Hank Sheinkopf, a veteran Democratic adviser. \u201cBut if the race gets closer, they could throw it either way.\u201d\n\nSheinkopf reasoned that this election has become more about personalities and less about what party leaders want. The long-term impact may be a significant shift in how people view Democrats and Republicans, he said. As it now stands, Stein, Johnson and McMullin could act as a convenient parking spot for voters disgusted with both candidates.\n\nEarlier this month, a federal judge rejected a challenge brought by Johnson and Stein arguing that the bar for inclusion is set artificially high. Yet there are signs the ground could be shifting. Mike McCurry, now co-chair of the Commission on Presidential Debates and a former press secretary for Bill Clinton, hinted that a third podium might be needed.\n\n\u201cSome of our production people may have said, \u2018Just in case, you need to plan out what that might look like,\u2019\u2019 McCurry told Politico. \u201cWe won\u2019t know the number of invitations we extend until mid-September.\u201d\n\nRon Faucheux, president of Clarus Research Group, a nonpartisan polling company, said there was broad support for including even minor candidates. \u201cPolls show that voters think third party candidates should be included,\u201d he said, \u201cand in an election like this, where polls show a majority of voters dislike both main party candidates, there is a good reason to give them the opportunity to at least look at other options.\u201d\n\nBut even Johnson and Stein were somewhat wistful about their prospects, casting themselves as agents of change who, at best, could represent the beginning of a break with the current two-party system.\n\n\u201cThe biggest message is \u2018consider us\u2019 as a very, very viable alternative to this two-party system that has become so polarized that they\u2019re not able to do anything,\u201d Johnson has said.\n\nStein advanced a similar argument. \u201cWe\u2019re having a political reorganization in this election because the Republicans are kind of falling apart,\u201d she said, \u201cand the Democrats have kind of split with a lot of the Bernie Sanders supporters just not happy with the alternative.\u201d\n\nShe argued that it was by elections about \u201cthe lesser of two evils\u201d that the country inherited many of its problems.\n\nBut first, the two have to get on TV.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no way I\u2019m going to win the presidency if I\u2019m not in the presidential debates,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cI do believe anything is possible given that right now, arguably the two most polarizing figures in American politics today are running for office.\u201d", "126": "The Republican presidential contest is not, regardless of what it seems some days, all about Donald Trump. There\u2019s another dynamic unfolding that has almost nothing to do with the businessman-politician currently atop the polls but that will have a major influence on who becomes the party\u2019s nominee.\n\nThis other struggle involves the competition among former Florida governor Jeb Bush, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) and Ohio Gov. John Kasich. History suggests that whoever emerges triumphant in this three-way rivalry will be in a strong position to claim the nomination, though admittedly the past has been a poor predictor of events so far in this campaign.\n\nEver since Trump surged to the top of the polls, the other candidates have been trying to assess both his staying power and the cost-benefit analysis of engaging him. Trump and Bush have clashed almost from the start, with growing intensity. More recently, as Rubio has risen, Trump has taken aim at him, and Rubio has responded in kind.\n\nNone of the other candidates has a clear strategy for taking down Trump. But they all think he will look like a different candidate \u2014 and in their assessments, a less formidable candidate \u2014 once the field narrows to three or four finalists after the voting begins. So they are beginning to focus on one another as much as they are worrying about him.\n\nWith the first contests still months away, none of the three yet looks like a front-runner. In the average of recent national polls, Rubio and Bush run fourth and fifth behind Trump, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson and former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina. Neither Bush nor Rubio breaks double digits. Kasich doesn\u2019t even break 5 percent.\n\nNational polls at this stage are less meaningful than state polls. In Iowa, where the first caucus will take place in early February, Trump and Carson lead, with Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) currently third. Bush and Rubio trail the first three, and Kasich is even deeper in the pack. In New Hampshire, Trump also has a big lead, but Kasich is jockeying with Fiorina for second, with Carson and Bush next and Rubio farther back.\n\n[Trump and Bush take on Rubio in New Hampshire]\n\nIn recent days, Bush, Rubio and Kasich have shown how much they\u2019re worrying about one another. They\u2019ve been sniping at each other and making other moves that underscore the significance of their competition.\n\nRubio has long emphasized that the party needs a fresh candidate, not one tied to the past, an implicit criticism of his fellow Floridian who is part of an American political dynasty. Bush, a two-term former governor, has belittled Rubio\u2019s experience, or lack thereof. Kasich, a two-term governor and longtime House member, has claimed that his experience and record are unmatched by any of the other candidates.\n\nAdvisers to the three anticipate more attacks ahead. \u201cThe Bush campaign is feverishly doing their opposition research on Governor Kasich and Senator Rubio,\u201d said John Weaver, Kasich\u2019s chief strategist. \u201cAn empire like that is not going to go quietly into the night. We\u2019re expecting pretty sharp elbows to be thrown. We\u2019re going to handle it head on.\u201d\n\nPast Republican nomination contests often have devolved into competition between a candidate from the center-right or mainstream conservative wing of the party and a candidate from the hard right or populist conservative wing. Most times, the candidate from the mainstream conservative wing becomes the nominee.\n\nThis year, the race is more scrambled because of the added factor of the apparent desire by many Republicans for an outsider or non-politician. That has elevated Trump, Carson and Fiorina and has forced the others to adapt. Rubio has been stressing that, despite being in the Senate, he\u2019s really not of Washington.\n\nInstead of establishment vs. tea party, one GOP strategist describes the race this time as a competition between those in the anger, or anti-Washington, lane, vs. those in the aspirational lane. Bush, Rubio and Kasich all fall more into the aspirational lane.\n\nWhat will make the difference? Based on how the three candidates are running, it\u2019s clear that they see the path ahead in slightly different ways, though each has handicaps he must overcome to win.\n\nBush has repeatedly pushed back at Trump by arguing that anger and insults cannot win the presidency. He seeks to be the aspirational candidate, conservative enough because of his record in Florida to be acceptable to a conservative party, while offering a positive and inclusive message that reaches beyond the GOP coalition.\n\nBut many Republicans see Bush as least able to appeal across the entire party \u2014 not much more able to appeal to the hard right than Cruz would be able to attract mainstream conservatives.\n\nLodged firmly in the establishment wing as the son and brother of former presidents, he faces resistance on the far right and among those yearning for an outsider. His hope is that he can change perceptions of himself, outlast his rivals with superior resources and persuade Republicans that he\u2019s their best hope to win a general election.\n\nSally Bradshaw, Bush\u2019s senior adviser, said the key remains what it has been from the start of the campaign: to portray Bush as a conservative reformer by stressing what he did in Florida. \u201cPeople don\u2019t know that yet,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen that message burns in, his numbers are going to change. That\u2019s his path.\u201d\n\n[What the pundits said then and now about Donald Trump]\n\nKasich is looking to the traditional model. He is the compassionate conservative of 2016 who hopes to strike first in New Hampshire and build from there. His advisers believe that, eventually, he can reach across the divide in the party to become the nominee.\n\nBut the party has not only moved right in the past decade, it also has developed a harder edge than when George W. Bush ran as a compassionate conservative in 2000. Kasich\u2019s support for expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act is just one example of a position that will not sit well with many conservatives.\n\nRubio\u2019s team sees crosscutting appeal as vital, a race that will favor a candidate who can best unite a fractured party. The senator\u2019s goal is to demonstrate skills as a communicator, to show depth on the issues, to turn his personal story into a positive message for the party, to make as few errors as possible and over time generate enthusiasm across the GOP coalition.\n\nRubio, too, has vulnerabilities. His past support for a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, from which he has backed away, remains an obstacle in his path. So too does his personal profile, that of a youthful first-term senator with limited experience trying to become president \u2014 a profile not unlike that of President Obama when he first ran eight years ago.\n\nDavid Axelrod, who was Obama\u2019s chief strategist in both campaigns, often has said that voters look for a replacement rather than a replica in picking a new president. The adviser to one of Rubio\u2019s rivals put it this way: \u201cWhen was the last time this country elected two presidents with similar attributes?\u201d Rubio will be trying to dissuade his fellow Republicans that he isn\u2019t another Obama.\n\nThere are wild cards in the calculations of all three camps. Maybe New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who occupies similar space, will catch fire in New Hampshire and elsewhere, although the resistance to him within the party is significant. Fiorina has demonstrated fearlessness that has jarred even Trump and can appeal across the party. Carson remains a candidate of unknown potential.\n\nLast, there is the Trump factor and what his support represents. For now, he remains the dominant force in the GOP race. But the advisers to Bush, Rubio and Kasich see a turn in the campaign heading into the final months of the year, one that will heighten the competition among them with significant consequences for their party.", "127": "By Sarah Jones on Tue, Nov 1st, 2016 at 1:26 pm Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election, and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as \"partisan\".

So all of that email information that the media has been reporting came from a foreign entity that seeks to alter the outcome of the U.S. election. \nBut FBI Director James Comey struggled with not wanting to appear biased as the FBI investigated Russian interference with the U.S. presidential election, and so he told the Obama administration not to accuse Russia of the DNC hackings lest they be seen as \u201cpartisan\u201d. \nRepublican FBI Director James Comey advised the Obama administration not to publicly accuse Russia of hacking the DNC and more \u201con the grounds that it would make the administration appear unduly partisan too close to the Nov. 8 election,\u201d officials \u201cfamiliar with the deliberations\u201d told the Washington Post. \nThese sources with knowledge of the internal discussions spoke to the Post on the condition of anonymity. \nThere are a few reasons why Comey might want to keep his agency\u2019s investigation of Russian interference under the radar, but given his choice to publicly suggest that his agency might be re-opening its exhaustive investigation of Clinton\u2019s emails, which resulted from a Republican-led, bogus, overreaching and seemingly endless Benghazi investigation that also cleared Clinton, it seems odd that Comey was going to stay silent on the Russia matter. \nComey\u2019s decisions is especially odd given the reports that the Russians have been communicating and coordinating with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to the point that he is already \u201ccompromised.\u201d \nOnly one of these matters might allow a foreign power control over the United States president. \nThe same sources tell the Post that Comey made the decision to reveal the Clinton emails to Congress because he had already testified in that matter and said the investigation was closed, which suggests that he was concerned with his own reputation. \nNot sure I\u2019m buying that because if Comey really only cared about his own reputation ahead of not appearing partisan he wouldn\u2019t have said anything at all, but that doesn\u2019t mean that his motives were nefarious. \nThere might well be good reason for this \u2013 after all, this is the FBI and they can\u2019t tell us everything, but as of right now Comey has mishandled this `and appears to be trying to influence an election to help Republicans. Just because he is a Republican and just because he has donated to Republicans doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t doing his job properly. \nBut Comey has a lot of explaining to do right now.

He has failed to hide such discontent with the decision Americans have made. However, he described Trump\u2019s victory as a \u201clesson learnt,\u201d the importance of which \u201cgoes far beyond the borders of the United States.\u201d Little did he know, French politicians have interpreted this passage in their own reserved way. On November 10, the lower house of the Assembl\u00e9e nationale has passed the vote to impeach Hollande, passing the bill with 152 votes out of the total of 199, resulting in the president of the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, Claude Bartolone, officially submitting a draft resolution for Hollande\u2019s impeachment. The impeachment procedure has only been introduced in 2014 in accordance with Article 68 of the French Constitution. According to the laws of the Fifth Republic, a president can only be impeached if he blatantly ignored his duties. To start this procedure, one would have to obtain 58 votes in the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale, where the Republicans are now holding a total of 193 seats. The demand for Hollande to leave was signed by a total 152 deputies, including the Republican Spokesperson in the Assembly, Christian Jacob and the former Prime-Minister Fran \u00e7 ois Fillon. The Right are convinced that Hollande should be held liable for disclosing state secrets in his book with the telling title \u201c A President Shouldn\u2019t Say This \u201c (U n pr \u00e9 sident ne devrait pas dire \u00e7 a \u2026). They are convinced that a president should know better than putting down all the details of French secret service operations aimed at assassinating terrorist leaders abroad. If the draft is to be found valid, it will be handed over to a special judicial committee of the the lower house of the the Assembl\u00e9e Nationale. Finally, when everything is said and done, the two houses will form the Republican High Court that will decide the fate of the sitting president. But regardless of how the impeachment procedure turns out in the end, this whole affairs has literally ended Hollande\u2019s political career, since he has no chance to get reelected. Therefore, one could use the words of the above mentioned song : \u00ab Monsieur Malbrough est mort \u00bb ( Malbrough is now dead ). However, this wasn\u2019t much of a surprise for anyone who has been following French politics, since, according to Le Figaro , Hollande\u2019s approval rating has hit an all time low of 11%. No President in French history enjoyed less support from the population, with even the Socialist party reluctant to back up Hollande\u2019s policies, with only 34% supporting him. However, it seems unlikely that Hollande will be the only European leader that will have to face the consequences of his mindless support of US President Obama\u2019s warmongering policies that have, at the end of the day, inflicted serious damage to EU interests.

Ritchie,\u00a0former head of criminal investigations for D.C. police, wrote\u00a0in a post on Facebook on Sunday.\n\n[The death of Antonin Scalia: Chaos, confusion and conflicting reports]\n\nScalia was found dead in his room at a luxury hunting resort in the state\u2019s Big Bend region by the resort\u2019s owner. It took hours for authorities to find a justice of the peace. When they did, Presidio County Judge Cinderela Guevara pronounced Scalia dead of natural causes without seeing the body \u2014 which is permissible under Texas law \u2014 and without ordering an autopsy.\n\nOn Sunday, the U.S. Marshals Service, which provides security for Supreme Court justices, said that Scalia had declined a security detail while at the ranch, so marshals were not present when he died. When the marshals were notified, deputy marshals from the Western District of Texas went to the scene, the service said in a statement.\n\nGuevara said she declared Scalia dead based on information from law enforcement officials on the scene, who assured her that \u201cthere were no signs of foul play.\u201d She also spoke to Scalia\u2019s doctor, who told her that the justice had been to see him Wednesday and Thursday last week for a shoulder injury and that he\u00a0had ordered an MRI for Scalia, according to\u00a0WFAA-TV in Dallas.\u00a0The 79-year-old justice also suffered from several chronic conditions, Guevara said.\u00a0She said she was awaiting a statement from the physician\u00a0to complete Scalia\u2019s\u00a0death certificate.\n\nThe manager of the El Paso funeral home that handled Scalia\u2019s body said Scalia\u2019s family insisted on not having an autopsy done. But the decision has spawned a host of conspiracy theories online, as well as skeptical questions from law enforcement experts such as\u00a0Ritchie.\n\n\u201cYou have a Supreme Court Justice who died, not in attendance of a physician,\u201d he wrote. \u201cYou have a non-homicide trained US Marshal tell the justice of peace that no foul play was observed. You have a justice of the peace pronounce death while not being on the scene and without any medical training opining that the justice died of a heart attack. What medical proof exists of a myocardial Infarction? Why not a cerebral hemorrhage?\u201d\n\nIn an interview with The Washington Post, Guevara has said she rebutted a report by a Dallas TV station that Scalia had died of \u201cmyocardial infarction.\u201d She said she meant only that his heart had stopped.\n\nRitchie also raised questions about the marshals\u2019 actions:\n\n\u201cHow can the Marshal say, without a thorough post mortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack\u2026\u201d \u201cDid the US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have suggested suffocation? Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest poisoning? My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for the marshals service said Monday that the marshals did not make a formal determination of death. He directed questions to the county judge who made the call.\n\nScalia\u2019s physician,\u00a0Brian Monahan, is a U.S. Navy rear admiral and the attending physician for the U.S. Congress and Supreme Court. He declined to comment on Scalia\u2019s health when reached by telephone Monday at his home in Maryland.\n\n\u201cPatient confidentiality forbids me to make any comment on the subject,\u201d he said.\n\nWhen asked whether\u00a0he planned to make public the statement he\u2019s preparing for Guevara, Monahan repeated the same statement and hung up on a reporter.\n\nEva Ruth Moravec in Austin contributed to this report.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nWhy blocking Obama\u2019s pick could backfire on Republicans\n\nSupreme Court nomination process sure to be epic debate", "131": "a reply to: kruphix Theocracy? Tim Kaine? In September 1980, as violence and civil war erupted throughout Central America, a quiet American left Harvard Law School to volunteer with Jesuit missionaries in northern Honduras. Around him, the United States-backed military dictatorship hunted Marxists and cracked down on the Catholic clergy for preaching empowerment to peasant farmers. But some locals also looked warily on the bearded and mop-haired Midwesterner in their midst. Just a few hours south, the Central Intelligence Agency was using Honduras as a staging ground in its covert war against Latin American communism, with right-wing forces training for operations in El Salvador and Nicaragua. \u201cSome of the people were wondering what\u2019s going on, who is this guy?\u201d Tim Kaine, then a 22-year-old volunteer and now the Democratic nominee for vice president, said in an interview. He understood why. His mentors in the priesthood had also urged him to be wary of friendly American faces. Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story \u201cIt was a time of such intrigue and suspicion,\u201d Mr. Kaine said. Far from being a C.I.A. operative, Mr. Kaine was a young Catholic at a crossroads, undergoing a spiritual shift as he awakened to the plight of the deeply poor in Honduras. In its far-flung pueblos, banana plantation company towns and dusty cities, Mr. Kaine embraced an interpretation of the gospel, known as liberation theology, that championed social change to improve the lives of the downtrodden. In Honduras, his recitation of the traditional Catholic mealtime blessing changed to \u201cLord give bread to those who hunger, and hunger for justice to those who have bread.\u201d Honduran military leaders, American officials and even Pope John Paul II viewed liberation theology suspiciously, as dangerously injecting Marxist beliefs into religious teaching. But the strong social-justice message of liberation theology helped set Mr. Kaine on a left-veering career path in which he fought as a lawyer against housing discrimination, became a liberal mayor, and rose as a Spanish-speaking governor and senator with an enduring focus on Latin America.", "132": "\"I don't think he understands very well the situation.

Do we want this flood of refugees to continue?\"\n\nIn the interview, McCain also prodded Republican presidential candidates to \"think about Ronald Reagan and the way he conducted his campaigns.\"\n\n\"To impugn each other's characters and integrity is very harmful to each other, ourselves, and our chances of winning a general election,\" he said, without naming any specific candidates. \"I think there's a lot of people in the party that are not happy about the tenor of some of the remarks and the allegations about each other,\" McCain said. \"I'm afraid we will pay a price for it at the polls, and I hope we'll change.\"", "133": "The Donald Trump campaign is counting on \u201cundercover voters\u201d to win in November.\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway outlined her vision of how the Republican nominee could win in November despite consistently trailing in polls, during an interview with Channel 4 in the United Kingdom for the documentary President Trump: Can He Really Win?\n\nConway insisted that Trump\u2019s support was not reflected in polls because of the perceived social stigma of supporting the Republican nominee. \u201cDonald Trump performs consistently better in online polling where a human being is not talking to another human being about what he or she may do in the elections \u2026 it\u2019s become socially desirable, especially if you\u2019re a college educated person in the US, to say that you\u2019re against Donald Trump,\u201d said Conway.\n\n\u201cPeople who are supporting Donald Trump, who have not voted Republican in the past, who have not voted in quite a while, are so tired of arguing with family and friends and colleagues about their support of Donald Trump that they just decided not to discuss it.\u201d\n\nConway insisted: \u201cWe give people a comfortable way to express that maybe they don\u2019t want to vote this year and why that is.\u201d She described her method as \u201cproprietary\u201d. She said that as a result, she could reach these undercover voters \u201cin many different ways\u201d. She said: \u201cWe go to them where they live, literally.\u201d\n\nConway\u2019s statement echoes what in American politics is known as the Bradley effect, a phenomenon that describes the willingness of some white voters to tell pollsters that they are voting for an African American candidate while preferring the white candidate in the voting booth.\n\nIt is named for former Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley, who was favored in polls in California\u2019s 1982 gubernatorial election over his white Republican opponent, George Deukmejian, before suffering a narrow shock loss on election day. However, while its existence is disputed, anecdotal evidence for the phenomenon is mostly concentrated in the 1980s and 1990s. Conway\u2019s argument is that something fundamentally similar is happening in the US in 2016.\n\nSpeaking to Channel 4 earlier this month, Conway buoyed her claims by citing the UK\u2019s experience of the EU referendum vote.\n\nPolling suggested the UK would remain in the European Union, but it became clear on election night that the vote was going the other way.\n\nConway said: \u201cVoices are silenced in polls that really should be included because people are too reliant on lists, and they\u2019re excluding people who maybe feel so passionately about that issue, Brexit, or so passionately about this candidate, Donald Trump, that they\u2019re going to vote for the first time ever in many, many, many cycles.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the past week, Trump has begun to ditch his previous unscripted style, using teleprompters on stage at every rally. That is despite repeatedly bashing the technology in the past, saying in August 2015: \u201cI say we should outlaw teleprompters \u2026 for anybody running for president.\u201d\n\nThe shift toward making Trump a more predictable candidate came as Conway took control of the campaign. The top aide outlined the message she thought Trump should continue to emphasize: \u201cThe best Donald Trump is the Donald Trump who is talking about national and homeland security, economic growth and prosperity, ethics and why so many Americans dislike and distrust Washington and all its adjuncts, its consultants, its donors, its lobbyists, its politicians, its way of doing business.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite his adoption of teleprompters, Trump still veered badly off script in a rally in Akron, Ohio, on Monday night. The Republican nominee said: \u201cYou can go to war zones in countries that we are fighting and it is safer than living in some of our inner cities that are run by the Democrats.\u201d\n\nHe continued to claim that if he were elected, \u201cwe\u2019ll get rid of the crime. You\u2019ll be able to walk down the street without getting shot. Now, you walk down the street, you get shot.\u201d\n\nJust as there may be a cohort of undercover Trump voters waiting to emerge in November, it seems that despite Conway\u2019s best efforts, there is an undercover candidate who won\u2019t let a teleprompter keep his penchant for controversial statements hidden.", "134": "WikiLeaks: \u2018How is what Bill Clinton did different from what Bill Cosby did?\u2019 #PodestaEmails20 Posted at 10:29 am on October 27, 2016 by Greg P.

This week Trump unveiled details of his new economic plan, and the mainstream media is having a field day criticizing it . But the truth is that we simply cannot afford to stay on the same path that Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and the Democrats have us on right now. Millions of jobs are being shipped out of the country , the middle class is dying , poverty is exploding , millions of children in America don\u2019t have enough food , and our reckless spending has created the biggest debt bubble in the history of the planet . Something must be done or else we will continue to steamroll toward economic oblivion. So is Donald Trump the man for the hour? \nIf you would like to read his full economic plan, you can find it on his official campaign website . His plan starts off by pointing out that this has been the weakest \u201ceconomic recovery\u201d since the Great Depression\u2026 \nLast week\u2019s GDP report showed that the economy grew a mere 1.2% in the second quarter and 1.2% over the last year. It\u2019s the weakest recovery since the Great Depression \u2013 the predictable consequence of massive taxation, regulation, one-side trade deals and onerous energy restrictions. \nAnd Trump is exactly right about how weak this economic recovery has been. \nSo how would he fix things? \nThe following are 10 things that every American should know about Donald Trump\u2019s plan to save the U.S. economy\u2026 \n#1 Donald Trump would lower taxes on the middle class \nThe tax savings under Trump\u2019s plan would actually be quite substantial for middle class families. The following numbers come from a recent Charisma article \u2026 \n\u2022 A married couple earning $50,000 per year with two children and $8,000 in child care expenses will save 35% from their current tax bill. \n\u2022 A married couple earning $75,000 per year with two children and $10,000 in child care expenses will receive a 30% reduction in their tax bill. \n\u2022 Married couple earning $5 million per year with two children and $12,000 in child care expenses will get only a 3% reduction in their tax bill. \n#2 Donald Trump would lower taxes on businesses \nUnder his plan, no business in America would be taxed more than 15 percent. Alternatively, Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan would tax some small businesses at a rate of close to 50 percent. So Trump\u2019s plan would undoubtedly be good for businesses, and it would encourage many that have left the country to return. \nBut where would the lost tax revenue be made up? \n#3 Childcare expenses would be exempt from taxation \nFor working families with children this would be a great blessing. Without a doubt this is an effort to win over more working women, and this is a demographic that Trump has been struggling with. \nIt is definitely an idea that I support, but once again where will the money come from to pay for this? \n#4 U.S. manufacturers will be allowed to immediately fully expense new plants and equipment \nThis would undoubtedly lead to a boom in capital investment, but it would also reduce tax revenue. As an emergency measure this would be very good for encouraging manufacturers to stay in America , but it would also likely increase the budget deficit. \n#5 A temporary freeze on new regulations \nRed tape is one of my big pet peeves, and so I greatly applaud Trump for this proposal. I think that Bob Eschliman put it very well when he wrote the following about Trump\u2019s planned freeze on new regulations\u2026 \nIn 2015 alone, federal agencies issued over 3,300 final rules and regulations, up from 2,400 the prior year. Studies show that small manufacturers face more than three times the burden of the average U.S. business, and the hidden tax from ineffective regulations amounts to \u201cnearly $15,000 per U.S. household\u201d annually. Excessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion dollars per year, and Trump will end it. \n#6 All existing regulations would be reviewed and unnecessary regulations would be eliminated \nIn particular, Trump\u2019s plan would focus on getting rid of regulations that inhibit hiring. The following are some of the specific areas that he identifies on his official campaign website \u2026 The Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s Clean Power Plan, which forces investment in renewable energy at the expense of coal and natural gas, raising electricity rates; The EPA\u2019s Waters of the United States rule, which gives the EPA the ability to regulate the smallest streams on private land, limiting land use; and The Department of Interior\u2019s moratorium on coal mining permits, which put tens of thousands of coal miners out of work. \n#7 Donald Trump would fundamentally alter our trade relationships with the rest of the globe \nDonald Trump is the first major party nominee in decades to recognize that our trade deficit is absolutely killing our economy. I write about this all the time , and it is a hot button issue for me. So I definitely applaud Trump for proposing the following \u2026 Appoint trade negotiators whose goal will be to win for America: narrowing our trade deficit, increasing domestic production, and getting a fair deal for our workers. Renegotiate NAFTA. Bring trade relief cases to the world trade organization. Label China a currency manipulator. Apply tariffs and duties to countries that cheat. Direct the Commerce Department to use all legal tools to respond to trade violations. \n#8 Donald Trump\u2019s plan would be a tremendous boost for the U.S. energy industry \nBarack Obama promised to kill the coal industry, and that is one of the few promises that he has actually kept. Obama also killed the Keystone Pipeline, and right now the energy industry as a whole is enduring their worst stretch since the last recession. To turn things around, Trump would do the following \u2026 Rescind all the job-destroying Obama executive actions including the Climate Action Plan and the Waters of the U.S. rule. Save the coal industry and other industries threatened by Hillary Clinton\u2019s extremist agenda. Ask Trans Canada to renew its permit application for the Keystone Pipeline. Make land in the Outer Continental Shelf available to produce oil and natural gas. Cancel the Paris Climate Agreement (limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius) and stop all payments of U.S. tax dollars to U.N. global warming programs. \n#9 Trump would repeal Obamacare \nTrump claims that Obamacare would cost our economy two million jobs over the next ten years. And without a doubt, it has already cost the U.S. economy a lot of jobs . \nNot only that, but Obamacare has also sent health insurance premiums soaring, and this is putting a tremendous amount of financial pressure on many families. \nTrump says that he would \u201creplace\u201d Obamacare, but that is a rather vague statement. \nWhat exactly would he replace it with? \n#10 Trump\u2019s plan says nothing about the Federal Reserve \nThis is a great concern, because the Federal Reserve has far more power over the economy than anyone else does. It is at the very heart of our debt-based system, and unless something is done about the Fed our debt bubble will continue to get even larger. \nSince the Federal Reserve was created in 1913, the value of the U.S. dollar has fallen by more than 96 percent and our national debt has gotten more than 5000 times larger. For Trump to not even mention the Federal Reserve in his economic plan is a tremendous oversight. \nWe are in the midst of a long-term economic decline, and things have not gotten better during the Obama years. If you can believe it, a study that was just released by Harvard even acknowledges this \u2026 \nAmerica\u2019s economic performance peaked in the late 1990s, and erosion in crucial economic indicators such as the rate of economic growth, productivity growth, job growth, and investment began well before the Great Recession. \nWorkforce participation, the proportion of Americans in the productive workforce, peaked in 1997. With fewer working-age men and women in the workforce, per-capita income for the U.S. is reduced. \nMedian real household income has declined since 1999, with incomes stagnating across virtually all income levels. Despite a welcome jump in 2015, median household income remains below the peak attained in 1999, 17 years ago. Moreover, stagnating income and limited job prospects have disproportionately affected lower-income and lower-skilled Americans, leading inequality to rise. \nThat same study found that the percentage of Americans participating in the labor force peaked back in 1997 and has been steadily declining since that time\u2026 \nIf we continue to do the same things, we will continue to get the same results. \nDonald Trump is promising change, and many of his proposals sound good, but there are also some areas to be concerned about. \nUltimately, just tinkering with the tax code and reducing regulations is not going to be enough to turn the U.S. economy around. We need a fundamental overhaul of our economic and financial systems, and Trump\u2019s plan stops well short of that. But without a doubt what he is proposing is vastly superior to Hillary Clinton\u2019s plan, and so he should definitely be applauded for at least moving in the right direction.

On one hand, some of Trump\u2019s policies sound alright, but a lot of his proposals are dubious and a few are unrealistic. First of all, building a YUGE wall on the border is going to be very expensive and not very effective. Furthermore: \n1) He never really mentions how he is going to deal with Planned Parenthood. 2) He obviously has no full intention of abolishing some bureaucratic agencies such as the Fed Reserve, the FDA, the USDA, Department of Energy, etc. 3) Reckless spending and debt is going to continue, and tax revenue will never keep up with the expenses. 4) I am not sure how he is going to replace Obamacare. 5) His idea on how to combat ISIS is not practical. It would mean extorting the Middle East out of their oil and having a costly militarist operation in various countries. It\u2019s a recipe for World War 3. 6) Even though he is anti establismhment at heart, he is running on a major party platform, which is rigged and corrupt. He should\u2019ve refused to participate within the Republican Party and join an alternative political party. Jace Tate \nIsis took the oil didn\u2019t they William Lutz \nYeah they probably took it, but my point is that you don\u2019t easily defeat ISIS by confiscating the oil and having a double version of the Iraq War. By the way, I forgot to mention that DJ Trump never spoke openly about civil liberties or mass surveillance either. Hence, I suspect that he will strengthen the so called \u201cwar on terror\u201d, which God forbid he would do. No more George Dubya Bush please.

However the way the apple is peeled can only be determined post collapse, after the decision makers have decided the direction the country takes.

LIZ THE SHIZ \nask JFK what happens when you try to go after the fed, you can\u2019t can you? Priszilla", "138": "Given that Congress has become so utterly dysfunctional in recent years, it's tempting to think the upcoming presidential election will be fairly low-stakes. Does it\u00a0even matter what Jeb Bush thinks about tax policy or what Hillary Clinton is proposing on paid leave? Hardly anything will pass.\n\nThe next president won't need Congress to tackle global warming\n\nBut on global warming, it's a rather different story. Whoever gets elected to the White House in 2016 will have an enormous amount of influence over America\u2019s climate policies \u2014 and they won't need Congress to act.\n\nFor that, you can thank (or blame) President Obama. Over the past six years, the Environmental Protection Agency\u00a0has acquired unprecedented authority to regulate the nation\u2019s carbon dioxide emissions. Obama has used that power to enact a slew of new pollution rules, including CO2 regulations on coal plants, all with the aim of cutting US greenhouse gas emissions\u00a0at least 26 percent between 2005 and 2025.\n\nThe EPA will likely keep this authority to regulate carbon dioxide for the foreseeable future \u2014 unless it gets altered by courts or repealed by Congress. And many of the biggest decisions on how to use it will be left to the next president.\n\nIf, say, Hillary Clinton wanted to expand Obama\u2019s carbon rules to oil refineries or cement plants, she could. Conversely, if a Republican president skeptical of climate change wanted to bog down implementation of Obama\u2019s CO2 rules for coal plants, he'd be able to do that, too. (Though, as we'll see, Republicans may not have unlimited power to scuttle Obama's climate policies.)\n\n\"Any future administration will have a lot of room to be either more ambitious or less ambitious,\" explains Michael Wara, an expert on energy and environmental law at Stanford. And how the next president uses the EPA could have ripple effects around the world \u2014 and even decide the fate of ongoing international climate talks with China, India, and other countries.\n\nSo far, the 2016 candidates have been vague about which way they'd steer the EPA. Clinton\u00a0has said Obama's climate rules should be \"protected at all cost,\" but she's given little sign of whether she might expand them further. Meanwhile, Republicans like Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush\u00a0sound skeptical about tackling global warming, but they haven't said whether they might try to relax or even dismantle Obama's climate policies. So here's a look at what they could do.\n\nFirst, a recap of how the executive branch acquired so much power over US climate policy. Back in 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that the EPA must regulate greenhouse gases as pollutants under the existing Clean Air Act \u2014 if there's evidence that they endanger public health and welfare.\n\nIn 2009, Obama's EPA laid out this evidence, and that \"endangerment finding\" set in motion a series of rules to curtail US greenhouse gas emissions. Since this was being done under the auspices of the Clean Air Act, a law Congress had passed in 1970, no new legislation was required. The EPA could act on its own. The big actions so far:\n\nAdd it all up, and the White House\u00a0claims these rules put the US on pace to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at least 26 percent between 2005 and 2025. But whether that actually happens will depend on the next president.\n\nOkay, now let's assume it's 2017. There's a new president, and Congress is still totally gridlocked on climate change. What happens next?\n\nThe next president likely won't be able to dismantle Obama's climate policies entirely \u2014 not on his or her own. After all, the Supreme Court has effectively\u00a0ordered the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases so long as there's evidence that they cause harm, and\u00a0that evidence is quite solid. Only Congress could undo everything Obama's done, by revising the Clean Air Act.\n\nStill,\u00a0whoever occupies the White House and EPA will have a lot of say in how to implement Obama's climate rules. That sounds boring, but it's actually a key step. There's tons of leeway to strengthen or weaken these rules. Here are a few ways this could play out:\n\n1) Fuel-economy standards could be tightened (or weakened) in 2017. Remember, the EPA's fuel-economy standards for new cars and light trucks are on pace to rise from their current 35 miles per gallon to 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025.\n\nAutomakers may push to relax the CAFE standards in the midterm review\n\nYet those numbers aren't set in stone. These CAFE (corporate average fuel economy) rules are scheduled to come up for a midterm review in 2017. At that point, automakers may lobby to allow the standards to rise more slowly \u2014 particularly if sales of fuel-efficient vehicles have been sluggish due to low oil prices. Green groups, meanwhile, could push to make the standards stricter, or to have them keep increasing past 2025, to push vehicle emissions down even further.\n\nSo the next administration will have to decide. Leave the vehicle standards alone? Make them stricter? Weaker?\n\nThe one twist here is that due to a longstanding quirk of the Clean Air Act, California\u00a0can threaten to create its own stricter standards if it's not happy with what the federal government is doing (and other states can join). Automakers really hate the idea of multiple sets of vehicle standards around the country, so they may prefer not to weaken the federal rules too much and risk having California go it alone.\n\n2) The Clean Power Plan will live or die based on implementation. The EPA will finalize its rules for reducing carbon dioxide from existing power plants in the summer of 2015. It's a core component of Obama's climate policy \u2014 power plants are responsible for 31 percent of the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. But the next president will have enormous influence over how this plan actually works.\n\nAssuming the rule holds up in court, it could prove difficult for the next president to simply hit the kill switch on the plan and start all over. But he or she will get to decide how to implement it \u2014 and that's arguably just as significant.\u00a0After the rule is finalized, states will have another 14 months to submit plans for cutting emissions, though some will request extensions. That process could drag on until 2017 or 2018.\n\n\"There's a lot of latitude in the review process\"\n\nAt that point, the EPA will review each state's plans for reducing emissions from its power plants and decide whether the plans are acceptable. An administration that really wants to tackle climate change can make sure states are doing as much as is feasible. By contrast, a president who was less concerned about global warming could allow states that wanted to, like Texas, to submit less-aggressive plans.\n\n\"There\u2019s a lot of latitude in the review process,\" says Stanford's Michael Wara. \"The history of the Clean Air Act shows this. If you have a president who doesn\u2019t like climate policy, they could basically signal to the states that they\u2019re going to give a lot of compliance flexibility and allow states to make assumptions in their plan that reduce their costs.\" This would likely involve seemingly arcane tweaks to models and baselines that would be harder for green groups to challenge in court.\n\nMeanwhile, some states may outright refuse to submit any plans for reducing emissions.\u00a0(Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-KY, is already urging states to do exactly this.) If that happens, the EPA has the authority to impose its own federal plan on the states. The agency will unveil the details of this federal plan in 2015, though, again, implementation would be left to the next president.\n\nMeanwhile, industry groups are almost certain to challenge aspects of the rule in court. Adele Morris, the policy director for the Climate and Energy Economics Project at the Brookings Institution, points out that an administration hostile to Obama's EPA rule could defend it weakly in court. And if any parts of the rule get struck down, the next administration will get to decide how to redo it.\n\nIt all comes down to preference. \"If you have an administration that's friendly to [Obama's] policy, then you'd have continuity in implementation,\" says David Doniger, director of the Natural Resources Defense Council's climate and clear air program. \"But if you had an administration that wasn't as friendly, they could try to drag their feet or change the rules.\"\n\n3) The next president will decide whether to regulate other sectors \u2014 like refineries. The Clean Air Act doesn't just cover vehicles and power plants. Technically the EPA has the authority to regulate carbon dioxide from other sources, as well. Oil refineries. Cement plants. Trucks. Airplanes. The agency is regulating methane leaks from new oil and gas wells, but it hasn't touched existing wells. And so on. These sources all add up.\n\nThe Obama administration is leaving most of the decisions about what to do with these sectors to the next president. If Hillary Clinton comes in and wants to expand the EPA's authority here, she can. If Marco Rubio comes in and doesn't, he may have to fend off lawsuits, but he can likely hold off on doing this for a long time.\n\nAt this point, we only have a hazy sense for what most US presidential candidates think about global warming. But given how much power they have at their disposal, they should give more detailed answers.\n\nFor instance, Hillary Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta,\u00a0claims that she'll put climate change and clean energy at the \"top of the agenda.\" And Clinton\u00a0has said the EPA's climate rules should be \"protected at all cost.\"\n\nHillary says the EPA rules should be \"protected\" \u2014 but would she expand them?\n\nFine. So we know she'll veto any attempts by congressional Republicans to repeal the EPA rules altogether. But what else? Would she try to strengthen the fuel-economy rules during the 2017 midterm review? Would she want to expand the EPA's carbon regulations to oil refineries and chemical plants? Would she try to beat Obama's goal of cutting emissions at least 26 percent between 2005 and 2025?\n\nOn the other end of the spectrum, there's Marco Rubio, who\u00a0says,\u00a0\"I do not believe that human activity is causing these dramatic changes to our climate the way these scientists are portraying it.\" But what does that mean in practice? Would he weaken the vehicle rules? Abandon the US goal of cutting emissions 26 percent?\n\nThen there's Jeb Bush,\u00a0who says he's \"concerned\" about climate change and that \"we need to work with the rest of the world to negotiate a way to reduce carbon emissions.\" But, again, what does this mean? Would he keep Obama's climate rules in place? Strengthen them? Weaken them?\n\nSome green groups have started to focus on these questions. \"We definitely want to ensure that the next president is actually committed on building progress through the Clean Power Plan,\" Tiernan Sittenfield, senior vice president at the League of Conservation Voters, told me.\n\nFor now, many environmentalists have mainly been pressing Clinton on what she thinks of the Keystone XL pipeline. Yet that issue will probably be resolved before Obama leaves office. The EPA rules are far more relevant for the next administration.\n\nIt's worth being precise about what the EPA can and can't do here. The executive branch has acquired sweeping authority over the nation's greenhouse gas emissions. The Obama administration estimates that this authority alone could push emissions down 26 to 28 percent between 2005 and 2025.\n\ntruly drastic changes to our energy system would likely require Congress\n\nLooked at one way, that's a huge deal \u2014 a decisive break from the past, when emissions would go up and up seemingly without end. Looked at another way, it's a pittance.\n\nTo help avoid drastic global warming, the United States will probably need to push down emissions\u00a080 percent or more by midcentury. That would require truly staggering changes. It wouldn't be enough for coal and gas plants to get slightly more efficient under EPA rules. We'd have to replace virtually our entire energy system with a new, cleaner one.\n\nThat's the sort of thing that only Congress can really do. Only Congress can fund R&D for new technologies or offer subsidies for clean energy. Only Congress can bring about dramatic changes to our grid infrastructure. Only Congress can enact an economy-wide carbon tax. Barring some creative flexibility on regulations, these are things the next president just can't accomplish without cooperation from the House and Senate.\n\nWhere the EPA rules could have a more important effect is on the international stage \u2014 at least in the near term. Remember, the United States only accounts for about 17 percent of worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. There's also China, India, Brazil, Europe, Russia, and so on. That's why international cooperation on climate change is so crucial.\n\nRight now, the world is groping toward a very, very weak international agreement. The US put forward its pledge to cut emissions at least 26 percent between 2005 and 2025. That spurred China to respond by vowing to get its emissions to peak around 2030. Other countries have started to pitch in, too.\n\nAdd all these pledges up, and we're still not close to tackling global warming. The Climate Action Tracker\u00a0estimates that we're on pace for global average temperatures to rise 3.1\u00b0C (or 5.6\u00b0F) above pre-industrial levels, give or take \u2014 a seriously disruptive change.\n\n\"What the US has done with China is a big step in changing the dynamics\"\n\nEven so, some experts think even these weak promises could lead, iteratively, to stronger action over time. \"You can see how those plans could start to connect together and create a positive negotiating dynamic,\" David Victor, a political scientist at UC San Diego's School of International Relations and Pacific Studies, told me. \"The encouraging precedent here is in trade ... You build credibility and trust over time and then move to bigger issues.\"\n\nThe next US president can help decide how this agreement continues to evolve in the years to come. The US can keep pushing its own emissions down and try to persuade countries like China and India to respond in kind. Or it could abandon this budding framework entirely.\n\nAbandoning the US climate targets, says Wara, \"would do real damage to whatever credibility the US has left on the international stage. What Obama has done with China is a big step in changing the dynamics in a very positive way. And if the US were to walk away from that, that would be very damaging for future climate negotiations and commitments.\"", "139": "You are here: Home / US / Look at the SHOCKING Number of Kids Born To Illegals in 2014 Look at the SHOCKING Number of Kids Born To Illegals in 2014 October 27, 2016 \nAccording to the Pew Research Center\u2019s latest numbers, in 2014, 275,000 anchor babies were born in the United States \u2014 enough to fill Orlando, Florida. \nThe Washington Examiner reported : \nMoms in the United States illegally gave birth to 275,000 babies in 2014, enough birthright U.S. citizens to fill a city the size of Orlando, Florida, according to an analysis of data from the National Center for Health Statistics. \nThe data showed that newborns to illegals accounted for 7 percent of all births in 2014, according to the analysis from the Pew Research Center. \nThe report reviews births to unmarried foreign-born and American born women. Those who are foreign born, including illegals, are seeing their birthrate drop, though it is still making up for the decline in births by American women. \nPew\u2019s recently-released report read: \u201cIn 2014, about 275,000 babies were born to unauthorized-immigrant parents in the U.S., accounting for about 7 percent of all U.S. births, and 32 percent of all U.S. births to foreign-born mothers.\u201d The share of new mothers who are teenagers is higher among the U.S. born (6%) than among the foreign born (2%) https://t.co/d6f9C9ALoR pic.twitter.com/ydJpV2NgXh \n\u2014 Pew Research Center (@pewresearch) October 26, 2016 \n\u201cA third of all births to foreign-born mothers were to unmarried women \u2013 down from a peak of 37 percent in 2008.

In 2014, there were 4 million births in the U.S., compared with 3.74 million in 1970. \nThis growth has been driven entirely by the increasing numbers of babies born to immigrant women. In 2014, immigrant women accounted for about 901,000 U.S. births, which marked a threefold increase from 1970 when immigrant women accounted for about 274,000 births. Meanwhile, the annual number of births to U.S.-born women dropped by 11 percent during that same time period, from 3.46 million in 1970 to 3.10 million in 2014. \nSo, do you think that all these people coming here, in many cases illegally, have assimilated to our culture and/or are planning on doing so?

If Secretary Clinton\u2019s email server was of sufficient interest to establish a new FBI standard of transparency, then surely the criminal prosecution of those responsible for the 2008 financial crisis should be subject to the same level of transparency. \nAs a consequence of the 2008 crash, trillions of dollars in American housing wealth was destroyed. Millions of Americans were touched personally as they lost their homes, their jobs, or both. Hundreds of pension funds were eviscerated, and millions of retirees saw their financial futures wiped out. Congress created the FCIC to examine what went wrong and to determine Whether any individuals or entities deserved law enforcement scrutiny as a result of their actions in this crisis. The FCIC followed the law and sent such referrals to the DOJ, yet not a single senior Wall Street executive has ever been criminally prosecuted. \nFor the uncounted millions of Americans whose lives were changed forever and for those who are still dealing with the consequences of the crash, I can think of no matter of intense public interest about which the American people deserve the details than the issue of what precisely happened to the criminal referrals that followed the 2008 crash.\u201d \nUntil now, the FBI has never, ever released the investigatory file of anyone or any institution it has targeted. However, if the Democratic nominee herself was a bank, then she would have nothing to fear from the FBI. \nMassachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is laser focused on protecting the American people from shady banks and financial scams, but the newly transparent FBI apparently doesn\u2019t share her concern since those investigations don\u2019t involve Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. To date, no executive has been criminally prosecuted for financial crimes by banks, Wall Street firms and lending institutions which caused the Great Bush Recession\u2019s mass unemployment and foreclosure epidemic. \nOf 25 entities named by the FCIC to be criminally investigated , only one actual person has paid a civil penalty, and another person \u2013 none other than Daniel Mudd, former CEO of mortgage giant Fannie Mae, was fined \u2014 but had his $100,000 penalty paid by the government sponsored enterprise that employed him. \nFBI Director James Comey has deployed a massive double standard to protect the criminal financial institutions, handing them a free pass and complete secrecy for collapsing our national economy and wiping out $3 Trillion dollars in home equity, stock equity and savings, while dragging Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton through the mud for Comey\u2019s partisan predilections for transparency when she\u2019s demonstrably done absolutely nothing wrong. \nThe FBI Director himself admitted in July that \u201cno reasonable prosecutor\u201d would bring charges against the Democratic nominee, yet he himself cannot resist rehashing and releasing the investigatory details in public over and over. Releasing anything about an investigation, or even delivering an actual indictment, actually violates Department of Justice policy to remain silent in the 60 days before an election. It\u2019s been described by former top Justice Department officials as the \u201cdifference between being independent and flying solo.\u201d \nElizabeth is right. How long will the FBI wait to deliver transparency to the American people eight years after their jobs, homes and savings were attacked by irresponsible bankers? \nOnce the FBI completes disclosing those investigatory files, then how long will it take for them to deliver indictments and justice to the men and women who caused the Great Recession? \nNeither can happen soon enough.

October 28, 2016", "145": "Are the wheels coming off the Iran deal? Less than a year after Iran, America, and five other world powers inked a comprehensive nuclear accord, a debate over its terms has erupted anew.\n\nIn Washington, the braggadocio of a prominent White House aide is fueling Republican accusations that President Obama deliberately deceived the Congress and the country about Iran and the deal. And in Tehran, frustration over the residual impact of American sanctions has prompted increasingly resentful accusations from Iranian leaders that the United States has failed to live up to its end of the bargain. As a result, some are fretting that the deal is \u201cat risk\u201d and are laying blame on the White House doorstep.\n\nBoth claims are spurious, and deserve a more forceful rebuttal from the Obama administration. In the end, however, the ruckus over recent comments by Deputy National Security Advisor Ben Rhodes is largely an inside-the-Beltway drama\u2014one that provides endless entertainment for Washington insiders but has little real significance for deal or American diplomacy.\n\nBy contrast, Iran\u2019s dissatisfaction presents a serious diplomatic dilemma for Washington. But it should not be interpreted as evidence that the deal is \u201cunraveling.\u201d Rather, the chorus of complaints from Tehran demonstrates the accord signed in July 2015 is working exactly as it was intended\u2014forestalling Iranian nuclear ambitions while amplifying the incentives for further reintegration into the global economy.\n\nObama\u2019s handling of this first real test of the nuclear agreement will be crucial for sustaining its credibility. For the sake of the deal, and for any prospect of a durable Thermidor for the revolutionary state, Washington should resist the temptation to assuage Iran\u2019s post-deal growing pains. If Iranians wants wholesale economic rehabilitation, their leadership needs to embrace the kind of policies that would yield that\u2014in other words, meaningful political, economic, and foreign policy reform.\n\nNot surprisingly, Iranian officials are seeking a quicker fix, and they have mounted an intense campaign to wrest supplementary sanctions relief from Washington. Their principal argument is that the theocracy has been stiffed. On an April visit to Washington, Valiollah Seif, the head of Iran\u2019s Central Bank, questioned the benefits of the nuclear agreement, insisting that Tehran has received \u201calmost nothing\u201d of the sanctions relief that was promised as part of the deal, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Mohammad Javad Zarif, the country\u2019s smooth-spoken foreign minister, has contended that \u201cthe United States needs to do way more,\u201d warning that \u201cif one side does not comply with the agreement then the agreement will start to falter.\u201d\n\nAnd Iran\u2019s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, charged recently that \u201cthe Americans are engaged in obstruction and deception, adding: \u201con paper, the Americans say banks can trade with Iran but in practice they act in such an Iranophobic way that no trade can take place with Iran.\u201d\n\nAdding fuel to the fire are changes to U.S. visa policies that are perceived at constraining Iran\u2019s economic rebound, deliberately inflammatory rhetoric from the U.S. Congress, and a recent Supreme Court verdict that paves the way for a $2 billion payout to victims of terrorist attacks attributed to Tehran or its proxies. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has described the decision as \u201cflagrant theft\u201d and evidence of enduring American hostility toward Tehran.\n\nTehran\u2019s narrative plays equally well to its essential constituencies: the revolution\u2019s power brokers, steeped in official narratives of American treachery; an Iranian citizenry impatient for its long overdue peace dividend; and a European business community anxious to reclaim its piece of the pie after an unwelcome five years of having to forgo a lucrative market.\n\nAnd it wouldn\u2019t be the first time Tehran got cold feet about its nuclear obligations out of an unfortunate sense of that the payoff was insufficient. In 2005, two years after a deal with Britain, France, and Germany to suspend core aspects of its nuclear program, Iran\u2019s leadership soured on that deal and reneged. Anxiety about a repeat performance is prompting new U.S. efforts to facilitate business in Iran and a mounting debate in the press and on Capitol Hill around additional American sanctions relief.\n\nBut Iran\u2019s campaign is grounded in a fundamental falsehood: that Washington has failed to live up to its end of the bargain. In fact, Washington has delivered fully on the sanctions relief pledged under the JCPOA, and officials in the White House, State Department, and even the enforcement office of the Treasury Department have engaged in extraordinary outreach to clarify remaining restrictions and underscore American commitment to the terms of the deal.\n\nMoreover, the rewards of Iran\u2019s nuclear concessions are actually widely evident\u2014in the volume of new trade and investment that is already underway; in the scope and velocity of diplomatic and commercial reengagement with Iran; in the swifter-than-anticipated revival of oil exports. Heads of state from Italy and India, from South Korea to South Africa are beating a path to Tehran, accompanied by contingents of eager investors. Meanwhile, Iranian officials including Seif\u2014chief of the same Central Bank that was formerly barred by sanctions\u2014headline swanky conferences aimed at wooing European business players. The great Iranian gold rush is on.\n\nThe catch is that the money is moving more slowly than Iranian officials seem to have anticipated\u2014and the trickle-down effect has been almost nonexistent for the average Iranian. The explanation for this lag is complex and multi-dimensional.\n\nFirst and foremost, Iran is hard hit by the decline in oil prices, which have fallen by roughly 60 percent since the interim nuclear deal was signed in November 2013. Even in the best of times, the Islamic Republic was never a particularly easy place to do business, and many of its structural economic problems have been exacerbated by a decade of sanctions and the particularly egregious mismanagement of the 2005 to 2013 tenure of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n\nIran\u2019s designation since 2008 as a \u201chigh-risk and non-cooperative\u201d jurisdiction by Financial Action Task Force, a multilateral body established to combat money laundering and terrorist finance, poses additional hurdles for banks. In addition, a host of other market distortions induce investor caution: corruption, a bloated and opaque banking system, an inflexible labor market, unattractive contract terms for energy investments, the traditional dominance of the public sector.\n\nTehran\u2019s challenges in luring capital is further complicated by its reputation for provocative domestic and regional behavior. Torching embassies, arresting tourists and dual-national businessmen, testing ballistic missiles\u2014none of this provides a conducive context for Iran\u2019s reintegration into the global economy. As the old adage goes, capital is a coward, and the Islamic Republic is a haunted house.\n\nIran has seen this all before. Similar factors undercut Tehran\u2019s previous efforts to open up to the global economy. In the early 1990s, after the long war with Iraq, then-President Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani sought foreign trade and investment as part of his massive reconstruction program. Initial outcomes were encouraging, but falling oil prices, excessive short-term debt, and the perpetuation of an ideological foreign policy drove away investors and undermined his economic reforms.\n\nThis time around, American sanctions have cast a long shadow. The nuclear deal left intact an array of restrictions: the primary U.S. embargo on Iran as well as financial measures that preclude access to the U.S. dollar and penalize third countries for doing business with Iranian individuals and entities that are involved with terrorism or other malfeasance. The vestiges of the sanctions regime create truly epic compliance issues for any international investor. And the hangover effect of a decade of stringent (and costly) enforcement has generated a culture of overcompliance in the international financial sector, since institutional due diligence is an integral dimension of the industry\u2019s viability.\n\nNone of this should come as a surprise to Tehran; American officials were crystal clear throughout the negotiations and in advocating on behalf of the deal that the deal only removed the nuclear-related sanctions and that U.S. measures imposed as a result of Iran\u2019s support for terrorism, its human rights abuses, or other issues would remain intact. And every sensible analyst looked past the inflated rhetoric of the deal\u2019s opponents, who brayed against the deal as a massive \u201ccash bonanza,\u201d to recognize that the residual sanctions regime would remain a significant factor in Iran\u2019s post-deal economic picture. As I wrote at the time:\n\nSo if this was entirely predictable, why is Tehran crying foul now? Unlike in the United States\u2014where the agreement\u2019s shortcomings were oversold (if anything) rather than downplayed\u2014in Iran there was a triumphalism with which the deal was sold domestically. This was mostly because of the peculiarities of Iran\u2019s political system. To avoid the appearance of contravening the \u201cred lines\u201d articulated by Khamenei, the country\u2019s ultimate authority, Iranian negotiators depicted the JCPOA as delivering wholesale sanctions relief. Rouhani described the outcome as a \u201clegal, technical, and political victory\u201d for the country, emphasizing that Tehran achieved \u201cmore than what was imagined.\u201d\n\nIran\u2019s politically motivated embellishments were exacerbated by the hype surrounding the deal, cultivated by entrepreneurs and aspiring middlemen who presented Iran in hyperbolic terms as \u201cthe best emerging market for years to come\u201d and \u201cone of the hottest opportunities of the decade.\u201d But while it may offend the Iranian ego, the relative scale of the opportunity in Iran is more modest than other much-heralded economic openings, such as China. It is hardly inconceivable that many banks and other firms have simply chosen to sit this first round out.\n\nNeither Iran\u2019s economic challenges nor the grievances of its leadership are \u201cfraying\u201d the nuclear accord; in fact, they only highlight its underlying logic. While the deal\u2019s scope was finite\u2014it was not a wholesale rapprochement or rehabilitation\u2014many of its supporters argued that its logic would prove self-reinforcing. Iran\u2019s gradual reintegration into the global economy would bolster the case among its leadership for a broader moderation of its domestic and foreign policies precisely in order to boost their benefits.\n\nTehran\u2019s dissatisfaction with the payout to date suggests this formula is working. A little bit of sanctions relief has whetted the entrepreneurial appetites of the clerical state. Despite official invocations proclaiming a \u201cresistance economy,\u201d the trickle of new trade and investment from Europe and Asia into Iran since the deal was signed has only intensified pressure for more\u2014and for more tangible dissemination of its benefits among the Iranian population. In other words, it is the success of the nuclear deal\u2014rather than its shortcomings\u2014that is driving the complaints that have emanated from Iran.\n\nThe United States is not responsible for the hesitancy of international capital and other economic hiccups that Tehran has experienced in the aftermath of the nuclear agreement. The culpability resides, as it always has, with Iran and the risks that its government\u2019s policies pose for international business. If Iranians want to see their nascent opening to the international community expanded\u2014if they want the peace dividend they have been promised, they need to look to their own leadership and its policies. If Iran\u2019s Central Bank governor wants \u201cnormal conditions\u201d and \u201caccess to the U.S. financial system,\u201d as he demanded during his Washington visit, let him return to Tehran and help instill the kind of reforms that would make those goals possible.\n\nThere are sensible steps that Washington can take to ensure that the provisions of the nuclear deal are fully feasible, including limited mechanisms for enabling transactions, such as the repatriation of previously frozen assets, that are specifically permitted under the deal. Such exceptional measures are reasonable\u2014not because they help Tehran, but because they help sustain consensus between Washington and its European partners and help preserve the West\u2019s negotiating leverage with any future targets of American or multilateral financial sanctions.\n\nHowever, it would be profoundly detrimental for Washington to provide significant unilateral relief to Tehran without reciprocal additional Iranian concessions. And the PR blitz by senior U.S. officials to reassure Iran\u2019s prospective foreign investors has taken on an unseemly tone, especially since existing sanctions prohibit U.S. persons from facilitating transactions with Iran by foreign entities.\n\nThese measures may be aimed at building confidence, but they ultimately have the opposite effect\u2014eroding Iran\u2019s incentives to abide by the deal, undermining any rationale for broader changes. Iran remains a risky place to do business, and it is in Washington\u2019s interests\u2014as well as those of Iranians and the broader international community\u2014that Tehran focuses on mitigating those risks rather than seeking to subvert their penalties.\n\nThe nuclear deal is working; Iran\u2019s nascent reintegration into the global economy is intensifying internal debates and popular expectations. This is all to the good. But to get more, Tehran will have to give more.", "146": "NASA\u2019s Cassini spacecraft discovered a static hexagonal storm four times the size of Earth crowning Saturn\u2019s north pole, including a clearly defined eyewall. Based on its size and movements, scientists have concluded that it\u2019s a vast cloud pattern generated by a gigantic, perpetual hurricane spinning at the center of the planet\u2019s north pole. Scientists estimate that this storm has been raging for decades \u2013 maybe even centuries.\nEach side on the northern polar hexagon is approximately 13,800 km long, and the whole structure rotates once every 10 hours and 39 minutes -a day on Saturn. In just four years, Saturn\u2019s hexagon has changed its color from blue to gold when Saturn\u2019s north pole gears up for next year\u2019s summer solstice.Saturn\u2019s hexagon is a six-sided structure that spans roughly 32,000 km (20,000 miles) in diameter, and extends about 100 km (60 miles) down into the planet\u2019s dense atmosphere. Because Saturn does not have land masses or oceans on its surface to complicate weather the way Earth does, its conditions should give scientists a more elementary model to study the physics of circulation patterns and atmosphere, said Kevin Baines, an atmospheric scientist at NASA\u2019s Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif., who has studied the hexagon with Cassini\u2019s visual and infrared mapping spectrometer. The last visible-light images of the entire hexagon were captured by NASA\u2019s Voyager spacecraft nearly 30 years ago, the last time spring began on Saturn. After the sunlight faded, darkness shrouded the north pole for 15 years. Much to the delight and bafflement of Cassini scientists, the location and shape of the hexagon in the latest images match up with what they saw in the Voyager pictures.\n\u201cThe longevity of the hexagon makes this something special, given that weather on Earth lasts on the order of weeks,\u201d said Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at the California Institute of Technology. \u201cIt\u2019s a mystery on par with the strange weather conditions that give rise to the long-lived Great Red Spot of Jupiter.\u201d\nThe hexagon was originally discovered in images taken by the Voyager spacecraft in the early 1980s. It encircles Saturn at about 77 degrees north latitude and has been estimated to have a diameter wider than two Earths. The jet stream is believed to whip along the hexagon at around 100 meters per second (220 miles per hour).\nEarly hexagon images from Voyager and ground-based telescopes suffered from poor viewing perspectives. Cassini, which has been orbiting Saturn since 2004, has a better angle for viewing the north pole. But the long darkness of Saturnian winter hid the hexagon from Cassini\u2019s visible-light cameras for years. Infrared instruments, however, were able to obtain images by using heat patterns. Those images showed the hexagon is nearly stationary and extends deep into the atmosphere. They also discovered a hotspot and cyclone in the same region.\nAs observed by NASA\u2019s Voyager and Cassini spacecraft, each point of the hexagon appears to rotate at its center at nearly the same rate that Saturn rotates on its axis. Along the rim of the hexagon, a jet stream of air is blasting eastward at speeds of 321 km/h (200 mph).\nWhile we\u2019re pretty confident that we know what Saturn\u2019s hexagon is, the big mystery is how it got there in the first place. Once you have a giant whirlpool of air, it\u2019s relatively easy to keep it spinning \u2013 but the force you need to get it wound up in the first place is a whole lot more difficult to explain.\nIt\u2019s fascinating that the Cassini spacecraft could have observed two completely different colors in the hexagon between November 2012 and September 2016:\n\nThe best hypothesis is that this is what it looks like when Saturn changes seasons. With a year that lasts 29 Earth years, Saturn changes seasons only once every seven years, and the increased sunlight over the past three years could explain the golden haze.\n\u201cThe color change is thought to be an effect of Saturn\u2019s seasons. In particular, the change from a bluish colour to a more golden hue may be due to the increased production of photochemical hazes in the atmosphere as the north pole approaches summer solstice in May 2017.\u201d\n\u201cInside the hexagon, there are fewer large haze particles and a concentration of small haze particles, while outside the hexagon, the opposite is true,\u201d Kunio Sayanagi, a Cassini imaging team associate at Hampton University, explained back in 2013. \u201cThe hexagonal jet stream is acting like a barrier, which results in something like Earth\u2019s Antarctic ozone hole.\u201d\nBut since Saturn reached its equinox in August 2009 \u2013 the point where the Sun is directly over Saturn\u2019s equator \u2013 it\u2019s been gradually exposed to more and more sunlight, which means that for the past three years, aerosols have been produced inside of the hexagon and around the north pole, making the polar atmosphere appear hazy and golden when photographed last month.\n\u201cOther effects, including changes in atmospheric circulation, could also be playing a role,\u201d NASA explained this week. \u201cScientists think seasonally shifting patterns of solar heating probably influence the winds in the polar regions.\u201d\nNASA scientists have an investigation underway to figure out what\u2019s actually going.\nThe Daily Galaxy via NASA/JPL-Caltech/Space Science Institute/Hampton University \nSource: The Daily Galaxy \n", "147": "Cyrus Mistry renames himself Rohit Sharma-Mistry, gets job back Posted on Tweet (Image via intoday.in) \nDeposed chairman of Tata Group, Cyrus Mistry, has hit upon a great idea to get back his job. At a press conference earlier in the day, Mistry announced that he shall no longer be known as Cyrus Mistry, and instead asked everyone to call him Rohit Sharma-Mistry. \nFifteen minutes after Sharma-Mistry\u2019s press conference, Ratan Rata called for a press conference and announced the group\u2019s decision to reinstate Cyrus Mistry as the chairman of Tata Group. \n\u201cMr. Sharma-Mistry is a rare talent who will be groomed for the future,\u201d said Tata. \u201cThe Trustees and other directors of Tata Sons are convinced about Mr. Sharma-Mistry\u2019s ability and firmly believe that when he gets going, he can turn around any business within one quarter.\u201d \nLater, our correspondent reached out to the jubilant Sharma-Mistry and asked him what gave him this idea.

It states that \"in connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation\" of Clinton's personal email server, which, Comey notes, he had previously told Congress was \"completed.\" \nHe states that he has agreed to \"allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation.\" He acknowledges that the FBI \"cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant.\" \nThe obvious question that arises is why, given the fact that the FBI has no idea whether these additional emails contain any significant information relative to the Clinton email case, the agency should make them a public issue within days of the election. Media commentators noted that the letter violates a longstanding informal FBI ban on making politically sensitive announcements within 60 days of a US election. \nFollowing the report of Comey's letter, the news media, citing unnamed federal law enforcement officials, said the emails in question were found on a laptop computer shared by Clinton aide Huma Abedin and her husband, former Representative Anthony Weiner. - Advertisement - \nWeiner is under FBI investigation for allegedly sending sexually explicit text messages to an underage girl. Abedin announced her separation from Weiner earlier this year after the latest episode involving Weiner and sexually explicit Internet activity became public. \nComey's letter was hailed by Donald Trump and Republican Party spokesmen as tantamount to an official reopening of the FBI investigation and rescinding of the decision announced by Comey in July that no charges would be brought against the Democratic presidential candidate. \nClinton spoke to the press briefly Friday evening, demanding that the FBI provide more information about the substance of what it was reviewing, including whether there was any connection to her use of a private email server. She pointed out that more than 15 million people have already voted and that many millions more will be going to the polls over the next week as early voting continues. In response to questions, she indicated that the FBI has not contacted her and that she first learned of the letter through the media. \nIt is at this point impossible to determine with precision the motivation behind Comey's letter and the political forces for which he is speaking. However, his attempt to present the letter as a politically disinterested response to the discovery of new information lacks any credibility. \nThis direct intervention into the election by the top police-intelligence agency can only be an expression of deep crisis and profound tensions within the American ruling class and the state. The election as a whole has been dominated by the growth of social anger and anti-establishment sentiment, yet it has ended in a contest between two right-wing representatives of the richest 1 percent who are despised by huge sections of the electorate. - Advertisement - \nIt has plumbed the depths of political debasement on the part of both candidates -- the fascistic billionaire Trump seeking to channel discontent along the most right-wing, chauvinist and racist channels; the multimillionaire Clinton relying on sex scandals and a McCarthyite attack on Trump as an agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin to bury incriminating revelations of corruption and lying and to swing public opinion behind a policy of military escalation and confrontation with nuclear-armed Russia. \nThe entire process has been surrounded by an aura of violence and a breakdown of public confidence in the political system. It has unfolded under conditions of deepening economic crisis, mounting international tensions and worsening crises for US imperialism around the world, i.e., the ongoing debacle of Washington's war for regime change in Syria, the signs of disarray in the anti-Chinese \"pivot to Asia,\" the emergence of open conflicts with imperialist \"allies\" in Europe, particularly Germany. \nThe convergence of these crises is generating bitter conflicts within the American ruling class over policy questions, magnified by fears of a rising tide of social opposition at home. \nWhether the intention of Comey's letter was to inflict fatal damage to Clinton's candidacy, shore up endangered Republican majorities in the Senate and House, or fire a shot across the bow against an incoming Clinton administration, it makes clear that the next administration will be mired in crisis from the day it takes office.", "149": "Archives Michael On Television If Donald Trump Wins, He Will Be 70 Years, 7 Months And 7 Days Old On His First Full Day In Office By Michael Snyder, on November 1st, 2016 \nA couple of weeks ago, it looked like Hillary Clinton was all set to cruise to victory , but now the FBI has delivered an election miracle in the nick of time. A few of my readers had criticized me for suggesting that Trump might lose, but I don\u2019t know who is going to win the election, and so all I had to go on was the cold, hard numbers. And a couple of weeks ago the cold, hard numbers were telling me that Hillary Clinton was going to win. Of course it is entirely possible that the national polls might have been seriously wrong, but even the state polls in the most important battleground states consistently had bad news for Trump. So things didn\u2019t look good for Trump at the time, but now that the FBI has renewed their investigation into Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails the poll numbers have shifted dramatically in Trump\u2019s favor . \nAs I write this article, the national polls have really tightened up. In fact, the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll puts Trump 1 point ahead of Clinton. Trump has all of the momentum at the moment, but that does not mean that he is going to win. As we have seen already in this race, one day can literally change everything. \nAnd as I noted yesterday , more than 23 million Americans have already voted, and most of that voting was done during a period of time when Hillary Clinton was doing very well in the polls. \nSo we shall see what happens. But if Trump does win on November 8th, there is a fact about his birthday which will start to get a lot of attention. \nDonald Trump was born on June 14th, 1946. If you move ahead 70 years from that date, that brings you to June 14th, 2016. Moving forward another 7 months brings you to January 14th, 2017, and moving forward another 7 days brings you to January 21st, 2017. \nAnd if Donald Trump wins the election, January 21st will be his first full day in office. \nOf course Trump would be inaugurated on January 20th, but he would only be president for part of that day. \nSo that means that Donald Trump would be 70 years, 7 months and 7 days old on his first full day as president of the United States. \nAnd this would happen during year 5777 on the Hebrew calendar. \nThese amazing \u201ccoincidences\u201d were first pointed out on Facebook by a user named Alyson Kelly. Some may take these numbers as a sign that Donald Trump is supposed to become the next president, but I want to make it exceedingly clear that I do not know what is going to happen, nor am I making any sort of prediction about what is going to happen. \nI just thought that this information was \u201cinteresting\u201d and so I thought that I would share it. \nSomeone that does believe that Trump is going to win is Glenn Beck. He was been virulently anti-Trump throughout this campaign, but now he is convinced that Clinton will be unable to overcome this new email scandal, and he is calling this renewed investigation by the FBI \u201cthe greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America.\u201d \nBeck also says that if Clinton wins now it will be evidence that \u201cmagic exists\u201d, and he is currently projecting that Trump should win the national vote by 5 points \u2026 \n\u201cLet\u2019s just say he was 8 points, that was fair to say, 8 points behind last week,\u201d Beck said, according to a transcript posted on his website . \u201cHe should win by 5 points.\u201d \nBeck later added: \u201cHow can the next president face a possible collapsing economy, possible war with Russia, and a current war with ISIS? Oh, and also, be under FBI investigation and indictment? Can\u2019t. Can\u2019t.\u201d \nThe conservative personality called the latest FBI revelation \u201cthe greatest gift given to any candidate of all time in the history of America\u201d and added that if Clinton still managed to win, it would be akin to proof \u201cmagic exists.\u201d \nHopefully Glenn Beck is right, because none of us should want to see Hillary Clinton in the White House. \nShe is the most evil, corrupt and scandal-ridden politician of this generation, and I can\u2019t understand how any American in their right mind could possibly vote for her. \nAnd the hits just keep on coming. Wikileaks has just released an email in which John Podesta told Clinton \u201cfixer\u201d Cheryl Mills that they were \u201cgoing to have to dump all those emails so better to do so sooner than later\u201d \u2026 \nIt was not entirely clear what Podesta meant by that phrase, but it could potentially be smoking gun evidence of obstruction of justice . \nBack in 2008, Barack Obama was new, intriguing and mysterious. We didn\u2019t know a lot about him, and so one can almost understand how the American people could have been fooled by him. \nBut in 2016, Americans know more about Hillary Clinton than they have ever known about any candidate in modern American history. \nThe Clintons have a history of crimes and scandals that goes all the way back to the 1980s, but about half the country is choosing to ignore all of that history and vote for her anyway. \nI believe that this election is America\u2019s final exam. Originally there were 17 Republicans and 5 Democrats running for the presidency. When you throw in the major third party candidates, that brings us to a total of approximately 25 people that the American public could have chosen from. \nIf the American people willingly choose the most wicked candidate out of all of them after everything that has been revealed, I don\u2019t think that anyone will be able to say that we don\u2019t deserve the bitter consequences that follow that decision. \nThe time for talking is almost over, and shortly we shall find out which path the American people have chosen. \nIf that choice turns out to be Hillary Clinton after everything that we have seen during this election cycle, I truly believe that we will have reached the point of no return as a nation.", "150": "Notable names include Ray Washburne (Commerce), a Dallas-based investor, is reported to be under consideration to lead the department.", "151": "\nThe Obamas refused to be photographed welcoming President-Elect Donald Trump and his wife Melania to the White House Thursday morning, according to a report by the Wall Street Journal .\n\u201cThe Obamas canceled a photo-op of the current and future first couples outside the south entrance of the White House.

(My goal there is to cover the stuff that the MSM is trying to sweep under the rug about their darling.) The Dakota Access Pipeline Protesters Are Being Brutally Attacked by Law Enforcement \nHave you been aware of the ongoing protests by the Standing Rock Sioux tribe about a pipeline being forcibly built across their watershed via eminent domain? They have been joined by other tribes to form a coalition of water protectors who say that the pipeline is a violation of a treaty established between the Sioux and the federal government. ( Here are the important things to know about the protest . Trust me, you\u2019ll want to read this.) \nEveryone who was paying attention breathed a sigh of relief when the US Government for once took a stand on behalf of the little guys back in September. \n\u201cThe federal government ordered a halt to work on a $3.8 billion four-state oil pipeline in the Upper Midwest on Friday, handing a temporary victory to the Standing Rock Sioux tribe and other opponents of the project\u2026 \n\u2026The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said it wouldn\u2019t authorize construction near Lake Oahe, a culturally important location to the tribe, until the agency determines if it needs to reconsider its previous approvals under the National Environmental Policy Act.\u201d ( source ) \nUnfortunately, the government\u2019s willingness to do the right thing was short-lived. Work has resumed on the pipeline and all hell is breaking loose \u2013 but not by who you might think. Protestors have been non-violent, but law enforcement has been absolutely brutal. They\u2019ve beaten up on young people, old people, and independent journalists covering the story. Hundreds have been arrested. \nThese people are protecting their water sources and their way of life, and they are being brutalized by our own government. The story you\u2019re getting on the mainstream is that the water protectors are standing there and that the police are standing there and that it is a relatively calm affair. \nThat couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. The AntiMedia (who would get a major journalism award if real journalists got such awards) has provided truthful coverage, and it is ugly. Every single person who is against government overreach should be supporting the water protectors. Right now, this affects some people up in North Dakota. But what about when someone wants to build something across your land? What about when someone wants to seize your home? What about when Agenda 21 comes to your back yard? \nHere\u2019s what really happened at the Dakota Access Pipeline protests . It\u2019s on film. It\u2019s ugly.

With all of this \u201cprogress,\u201d is humanity at risk of becoming obsolete? \nThousands of jobs each year are being turned over to computers as humans demand higher wages and better benefits for unskilled labor. We\u2019ve all ended up on the endless loop of talking to customer service robots on the phone or going to a checkout counter and discovering it is push button and digital. \nIs this all part of a greater plan to make the bulk of humanity utterly dependent on the whims of a few? \nI don\u2019t watch a lot of documentaries, but last night my daughter and I watched Obsolete .

It\u2019s fascinating from the moment you hit play. When it was over, we sat there in silence for at least a minute, aghast that we could see the whole thing happening around us right now. \nI can\u2019t recommend this highly enough.

Thousands of demonstrators filled the streets. Source: Federico Parra /AFP/Getty Images \nNPR reports : \nThe demonstrators were protesting \u201cwhat they call a sharp turn towards authoritarianism. The Maduro government has jailed opposition leaders, stripped Congress of its powers and cracked down on the press.\u201d \nAs for Maduro, he has blatantly threatened to jail anyone who tries to remove him from power, via elections or legal means, ironically citing the Venezuelan constitution : \n\u201cIf they launch a supposed political trial, which is not in our constitution, the state prosecution service must bring legal action in the courts and put in jail anyone who violates the constitution, even if they are members of Congress.\u201d \nWhat\u2019s more, in a conversation with the American DEA, Maduro\u2019s nephew says that Venezuela is at war with the US, which is news to most Americans. Efrain Campo was busted doing a quick cocaine deal in order to make money for the Venezuelan First Family. He was caught attempting to smuggle $5 million of Columbian cocaine into the US. The Charlotte Observer reported : \nEfrain Campo\u2026was recorded saying \u201cwe\u2019re at war\u201d with the Americans and laughing about sending opposition leaders to jail, according to the transcript, which was filed in federal district court in New York. \n\u201cWe need the money,\u201d Campo said, according to the transcript. \u201cWhy? Because the Americans are hitting us hard with money. Do you understand?

The offensive is said to start \u201cwithin a few days or hours.\u201d \nThe involvement of Shi\u2019ite militias in the \u201cliberation\u201d of Sunni Arab cities in Iraq has been controversial because they often end up carrying out extrajudicial executions, looting and torture of locals they suspect of being secretly in league with ISIS. \nAn effort to block flight from Mosul to ISIS territory is Syria would be an obvious step, but the militias\u2019 involvement again risks targeting of civilians, as the population of from Mosul is already overrunning the minimal camps set up for the displaced. \nCivilians fleeing these cities are usually not welcomed in Iraqi government-held territory, and wind up fleeing into other ISIS-held territory. With little left in Iraq, this likely means fleeing into Syria, and the militias\u2019 presence means the civilians displaced by the attack are likely to be targeted for fleeing \u201cwith\u201d ISIS.

The meeting is the first national finance council strategy meeting of Ready for Hillary, a \u201csuper PAC\u201d devoted to building a network to support Mrs. Clinton\u2019s potential presidential ambitions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re coming up with plans on how to engage emerging constituencies that will be incredibly important if there\u2019s a primary and in a general \u2014 whether that\u2019s women, African-Americans, Latinos, L.G.B.T.,\u201d said Mr. Stewart, who went on to run Mr. Obama\u2019s battleground-state strategy in 2012.\n\nThe all-day meeting at the Parker Meridien hotel will be closed to the news media, but a preview of the day, with panel discussions like \u201cWhat America Will Look Like in 2016,\u201d about changing demographics, and \u201cBuilding the Resources to Win,\u201d about developing a campaign infrastructure, provided an early look into what supporters consider Mrs. Clinton\u2019s strengths and potential pitfalls in 2016.\n\nMrs. Clinton has never had a problem raising money from deep-pocketed donors, but her 2008 campaign lacked the grass-roots enthusiasm and modest Internet donations that buoyed Mr. Obama. Ready for Hillary hopes to build that kind of support.\n\nA grass-roots super PAC may seem an oxymoron: such groups can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money on political races as long as they do not coordinate with a candidate. But rather than invest in expensive television ads, Ready for Hillary puts all of its donations into building its email list of supporters.\n\nFor every $25,0000 the group raises, it cuts a payment to Rising Tide Interactive, a firm that helps build online lists of supporters. A social media tool on the website will allow supporters to work together to organize to plan rallies and small-dollar fund-raising events. With no candidate and over a year before a potential campaign, Ready for Hillary has roughly a million names on its email list, about half the size of the Hillary for President campaign list at the time Mrs. Clinton suspended her campaign in 2008.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not our job to be a campaign and it\u2019s not our job to make decisions to tie any potential candidate\u2019s hands,\u201d said Craig T. Smith, an aide in the administration of President Bill Clinton and senior adviser to Ready for Hillary. \u201cThe goal is to build a list.\u201d\n\nThe strategy is an acknowledgment of mistakes made by Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign, but also a recognition that she cannot simply run as the establishment candidate with inside-the-Beltway support without also inspiring young and minority voters who largely favored Mr. Obama in 2008. Mr. Stewart helped Mr. Obama pick up delegates in small but important caucus states and turn states like Arizona, New Mexico and Virginia into battlegrounds by tapping into changing demographics.\n\nA lineup of longtime Clinton backers and aides will attend Tuesday\u2019s meeting, including Susie Tompkins Buell of San Francisco; Ann Lewis, a former adviser to both Clintons; Jennifer M. Granholm, the former governor of Michigan; and Tracy Sefl, a Democratic strategist. Along with Ms. Sefl, two young Ready for Hillary volunteers, Taj Magruder, 23, of Philadelphia, and Haley Adams, a student at Yale, will open the event, signaling that the Clinton world intends to bring in fresh voices, even if it means edging some loyal aides out.\n\nThe event signals a turning point for Ready for Hillary. The group, registered just before Mrs. Clinton left the State Department in February by young staff members who worked in junior roles on her 2008 campaign, was largely viewed as a makeshift organization that sold Hillary Clinton buttons and iPhone cases online.\n\nSome longtime supporters had worried that the group emerged too soon and that if it were not well run, it could hurt Mrs. Clinton\u2019s prospects, even though she is not involved or in contact with its organizers. But veteran aides like Mr. Smith, Ms. Sefl and Harold Ickes, a former deputy chief of staff in the Clinton White House, are now signed on as advisers. In recent months, the group has held events in several cities from San Francisco to Houston and has become among the dominant \u2014 if not best financed \u2014 political action committees on the Democratic side.\n\nThe sessions in New York will point to several advantages favoring a Democrat in 2016. \u201cDemocrats do have a series of advantages baked into the cake in terms of demographics and the electoral map,\u201d said Geoff Garin, a pollster who succeeded Mark Penn as chief strategist for Mrs. Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign.\n\nFresh off working on behalf of Terry McAuliffe in his successful campaign for governor of Virginia, Mr. Garin will talk about reaching the growing numbers of Hispanics and college-educated white women, and the decline in non-college-educated white male voters, one of the most challenging demographics for Mrs. Clinton. But, he added that some very big odds will work against any Democratic presidential nominee in 2016. \u201cSince World War II, the only time the same party won a third term in the White House was 1988,\u201d Mr. Garin said.\n\nSupporters are also well aware of the attacks Mrs. Clinton would face. During a lunch session, David Brock, founder of Media Matters for America, will lead the \u201cReady for the Right Wing\u201d tutorial on how to combat conservative attacks and misinformation in the media.\n\nThe future of Ready for Hillary is unclear. Should Mrs. Clinton run, the group would most likely dissolve, after encouraging those on its email list to transfer their support to the official Clinton campaign. The widespread belief is that several Ready for Hillary staff members would take up positions on the campaign, which has made the group somewhat of a way station for hopeful aides. If Mrs. Clinton does not run, the group would likely throw its support behind whoever becomes the Democratic nominee.\n\nEither way, this type of early unity and strategizing around a single candidate is a good thing and a rarity in Democratic politics, said Ronald Feldman, a Ready for Hillary national finance council co-chairman who supported John Edwards in 2008.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve never been paying this much attention this early on, but this time it seemed like a necessity,\u201d Mr. Feldman said.", "161": "Throughout the Middle East and North Africa today, Christianity is under attack.\u00a0 Terrorist organizations such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) are destroying some of the oldest and most sacred Christian communities and relics in the world on the very lands where Christianity was born and first took root. They are committing brutal atrocities against Christian communities in Syria and Iraq, persecuting religious minorities and destroying entire towns and local economies. Christians are fleeing their homes in increasing numbers, creating an exploding refugee crisis that will have grave ramifications on the stability and security of the entire region.\n\nWhile the world has been rightly outraged by the violence waged by ISIS against people of all sects, ethnicities, and religions, the United States, Europe and other key allies have done little to end ISIS\u2019s systematic efforts to drive-out and eradicate entire religious communities from their historic and sacred homelands. The Obama Administration has repeatedly refused to defend religious freedom abroad and continues to ignore its devastating cost to those religious communities targeted by terrorists because of their religious beliefs.\n\nAs a nation founded in the pursuit of religious freedom, America can and must do more to root-out the religious intolerance that is helping to foster much of the political instability and violence we see today. Specifically, we believe the Obama Administration should integrate the protection of religious freedom into its overall response to growing terrorist threats and development efforts around the world. Doing so would help to eliminate the underlying causes of violent extremism, promote increased international economic stability, and foster greater respect for human rights.\n\nPromoting religious freedom would, first and foremost, undermine the efforts of terrorist organizations such as ISIS to capitalize on simmering religious intolerance to build influence and wield power. ISIS has succeeded in tearing apart the social fabric of local communities and exacerbating sectarian and ethnic divisions to recruit supporters from disaffected populations and assert control over wide swaths of otherwise insecure territory. As a result, they have precipitated a breakdown of basic order that has allowed new and unprecedented security threats to the United States and our allies to fester and grow.\n\nThe Obama administration can counter this strategy by building alliances with popular local and regional leaders who can expose these radical ideologies\u2019 moral bankruptcy and champion pluralism and tolerance. The Administration should also combat terrorist propaganda about religious minorities and develop programs that promote tolerance and empower minorities to better advocate for their rights and interests. Only by reaffirming the importance of religious freedom and working closely with communities and their governments will we be able to strip away sympathy and support for ISIS and other extremist groups that is bred from deeper political, economic, and social grievances.\n\nProperly designed and implemented, a U.S. foreign policy committed to religious freedom can advance our national security interests, stabilize and consolidate the spread of democracy across the globe, help sustain economic growth, and promote the equality of men and women.\n\nMost importantly, it can help prevent religiously-motivated terrorism and undermine the conditions that have helped spur the rise of groups like ISIS, Boko Haram, and the Shuddhikaran Movement.\n\nPromoting religious freedom would also support the governance structures necessary for economic and political security in developing nations. As recent studies by groups such as the Religious Freedom and Business Foundation have found, higher levels of religious freedom are associated with higher levels of economic productivity and growth. Clearly, sustainable political and economic development is only possible when religious freedom and equal opportunity contributes to a secure environment in which citizens and businesses can operate freely.\n\nFinally, we must remain committed to religious freedom because of the special distinction religious freedom holds as a fundamental human right\u2014a belief that is shared by democratic countries across the globe and protected by numerous international treaties and agreements.\n\nAmerican support for religious liberty sends a potent and unmistakable message to threatened communities around the world: America is your friend. Such support builds enduring good will towards our country among those who could be leading their own nations in the years ahead. And it reminds all observers, whether friendly or hostile, that the U.S. remains committed to a world where justice and human dignity are central to legitimate governance.\n\nRepublican John McCain is a Navy veteran.

The program has nothing to do with information sharing legally required under a warrant, but rather consists of a business line through which the telecom giant stores customer data longer than peers in order to turn around and sell it to government agencies (no warrant required). This allows law enforcement to use secret and never disclosed evidence to build a cases against citizens via a shady and unaccountable practice known as parallel construction. \nThe article is titled, AT&T Is Spying on Americans for Profit, New Documents Reveal , and is a must read. \nHere are some key excerpts: \nIn 2013, Hemisphere was revealed by The New York Times and described only within a Powerpoint presentation made by the Drug Enforcement Administration . The Times described it as a \u201cpartnership\u201d between AT&T and the U.S. government; the Justice Department said it was an essential, and prudently deployed, counter-narcotics tool. \nHowever, AT&T\u2019s own documentation\u2014reported here by The Daily Beast for the first time\u2014shows Hemisphere was used far beyond the war on drugs to include everything from investigations of homicide to Medicaid fraud. \nHemisphere isn\u2019t a \u201cpartnership\u201d but rather a product AT&T developed, marketed, and sold at a cost of millions of dollars per year to taxpayers. No warrant is required to make use of the company\u2019s massive trove of data, according to AT&T documents, only a promise from law enforcement to not disclose Hemisphere if an investigation using it becomes public. \nThese new revelations come as the company seeks to acquire Time Warner in the face of vocal opposition saying the deal would be bad for consumers . Donald Trump told supporters over the weekend he would kill the acquisition if he\u2019s elected president; Hillary Clinton has urged regulators to scrutinize the deal. \nThe fact that this deal is even being considered shows what a giant joke this county has become. \nAs I noted on Twitter earlier this week: Why don\u2019t we just merge the entire S&P 500 into one company called Oligarchy Inc. and get it over with. \n\u2014 Michael Krieger (@LibertyBlitz) October 24, 2016 \nWhile telecommunications companies are legally obligated to hand over records, AT&T appears to have gone much further to make the enterprise profitable, according to ACLU technology policy analyst Christopher Soghoian. \nAT&T has a unique power to extract information from its metadata because it retains so much of it. The company owns more than three-quarters of U.S. landline switches, and the second largest share of the nation\u2019s wireless infrastructure and cellphone towers, behind Verizon. AT&T retains its cell tower data going back to July 2008, longer than other providers. Verizon holds records for a year and Sprint for 18 months, according to a 2011 retention schedule obtained by The Daily Beast. \nThe disclosure of Hemisphere was not the first time AT&T has been caught working with law enforcement above and beyond what the law requires. \nA statement of work from 2014 shows how hush-hush AT&T wants to keep Hemisphere. \n\u201cThe Government agency agrees not to use the data as evidence in any judicial or administrative proceedings unless there is no other available and admissible probative evidence,\u201d it says. \nBut those charged with a crime are entitled to know the evidence against them come trial. Adam Schwartz, staff attorney for activist group Electronic Frontier Foundation, said that means AT&T leaves investigators no choice but to construct a false investigative narrative to hide how they use Hemisphere if they plan to prosecute anyone. \nOnce AT&T provides a lead through Hemisphere, then investigators use routine police work, like getting a court order for a wiretap or following a suspect around, to provide the same evidence for the purpose of prosecution. This is known as \u201cparallel construction.\u201d \nParallel construction is a pernicious side effect of all this spying. It\u2019s a very important topic I covered last year in the post, How the DEA Uses \u201cParallel Construction\u201d to Hide Unconstitutional Investigations . \n\u201cThis document here is striking,\u201d Schwartz told The Daily Beast. \u201cI\u2019ve seen documents produced by the government regarding Hemisphere, but this is the first time I\u2019ve seen an AT&T document which requires parallel construction in a service to government. It\u2019s very troubling and not the way law enforcement should work in this country.\u201d \nThe federal government reimburses municipalities for the expense of Hemisphere through the same grant program that is blamed for police militarization by paying for military gear like Bearcat vehicles. \nThere\u2019s your government again. Tirelessly working against you from behind the scenes. \n\u201cAt a minimum there is a very serious question whether they should be doing it without a warrant. A benefit to the parallel construction is they never have to face that crucible. Then the judge, the defendant, the general public, the media, and elected officials never know that AT&T and police across America funded by the White House are using the world\u2019s largest metadata database to surveil people,\u201d Schwartz said. \nSheriff and police departments pay from $100,000 to upward of $1 million a year or more for Hemisphere access. Harris County, Texas, home to Houston, made its inaugural payment to AT&T of $77,924 in 2007, according to a contract reviewed by The Daily Beast. Four years later, the county\u2019s Hemisphere bill had increased more than tenfold to $940,000. \nAT&T documents state law enforcement doesn\u2019t need a search warrant to use Hemisphere, just an administrative subpoena, which does not require probable cause . The DEA was granted administrative subpoena power in 1970. \nJust another reason to end the failed war on drugs and close down the DEA. Recall, unconstitutional surveillance was actually pioneered by the DEA a decade before the 9/11 attacks. See: How NSA Surveillance Was Birthed from the Drug War \u2013 The DEA Tracked Billions of Phone Calls Pre 9/11 . \nAT&T stores details for every call, text message, Skype chat, or other communication that has passed through its infrastructure, retaining many records dating back to 1987, according to the Times 2013 Hemisphere report. The scope and length of the collection has accumulated trillions of records and is believed to be larger than any phone record database collected by the NSA under the Patriot Act, the Times reported. \nThis summer, I switched my cellphone service away from AT&T and was able to reduce my monthly bill by nearly 50%.

Numerous other likeminded groups are involved, just as cutthroat, just as ruthless, just as extremist, masquerading as \u0093moderate rebels\u0094 when none exist - supported by Washington, NATO, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, other Gulf States, Jordan, Israel and Turkey.They\u0092re massacring civilians, killing government soldiers defending them, using chemical and other banned weapons, committing gruesome atrocities.Why does Russia pretend conflict is civil when Syria was invaded by terrorists, imported from scores of countries, serving as US imperial foot soldiers? Why does it pretend \u0093moderate\u0094 fighters are involved when none exist? Why does it insist on separating nonexistent \u0093moderates\u0094 from terrorist groups it\u0092s combating when all anti-government forces are the same?Why isn\u0092t it targeting all armed groups wanting Assad toppled and Syrian sovereign independence destroyed? It\u0092s the only way to free the country from the scourge its facing - supported by Washington and its rogue allies, NATO and regional ones.Why did it halt its aerial operations to liberate eastern Aleppo, declaring a unilateral ceasefire, a so-called humanitarian pause - a major blunder, accomplishing nothing? Ongoing since October 18, it\u0092s letting US-supported terrorists infesting the city replenish their ranks, regroup and mobilize for heavy attacks, largely harming civilians Moscow says it wants protected.Last Saturday evening, Russia ended its humanitarian pause because US-supported terrorists in eastern Aleppo prevent civilians from leaving, holding thousands hostage as human shields, including the sick and wounded.Yet it ceased aerial attacks, yielding the advantage to dark forces it\u0092s sworn to eliminate. What kind of strategy gives them the upper hand? It gets worse.On October 26, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman General Igor Konashenkov issued the following statement:\u0093The Russian Aerospace Forces and the Syrian Air Force have been sticking to a moratorium on air strikes for the past eight days. They are staying out of a 10-km (six-mile) zone around Aleppo.\u0094\u0093Six humanitarian corridors, field kitchens and first aid stations are open for civilians leaving eastern Aleppo 24 hours a day.\u0094\u0093Russia and the Syrian government are ready to resume \u0091humanitarian pauses\u0092 in Aleppo if they receive guarantees from international organizations confirming readiness to evacuate the sick and the wounded as well as civilian population from the rebel-held areas.\u0094Fact: Maintaining an airstrike moratorium aids Washington, its rogue allies and terrorists in eastern Aleppo they support.Fact: What good are humanitarian corridors if eastern Aleppo residents are prevented from using them, risking death or serious injury if they try.Fact: International organizations have no control over terrorists in eastern Aleppo - or anywhere else in the country. So what good are their \u0093guarantees\u0094 if made?Fact: As long as Russia continues making the same mistakes repeatedly, the struggle to liberate Syria will likely go on interminably without resolution - a forever war, while countless thousands more civilians will die, be seriously injured and endure hardships people in Western societies can\u0092t imagine, victims of US imperial ruthlessness.A handful of eastern Aleppo civilians alone escaped via a humanitarian corridor. According to one now free, their relatives were seized, imprisoned and tortured.The only way to liberate thousands of others is by relentlessly smashing their terrorist captors, eliminating them - not giving them breathing room to mobilize for greater attacks.Washington is delighted with Moscow\u0092s ceasefire and humanitarian pause, serving US imperial interests, State Department spokesman admiral John Kirby saying:\u0093We welcome the stated intention to extend this pause, and we hope that this extension will be more successful than it has been thus far\u0094 - meaning the longer it continues, the greater the benefit to US-led dark forces, the worse off trapped Syrians in eastern Aleppo will be, the longer the struggle to liberate Syria will go on.Stephen Lendman lives in Chicago.

But it creates parameters for three more months of negotiations over technical details and some matters that remain unresolved. Any one of those issues could doom a comprehensive agreement. Among them is the pace at which sanctions will be suspended.\n\n\u201cThe political understanding with details that we have reached is a solid foundation for the good deal we are seeking,\u201d said Secretary of State John F. Kerry, sounding hoarse after an all-night negotiation session.\n\nThe key moments in the long history of U.S.-Iran tensions\n\nThe agreement includes almost all the restrictions on Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities, laboratories, mines and mills that the United States had sought in recent months, although it initially aimed for even tougher restrictions.\n\nBut Iran would get several benefits that may make the deal more palatable to politicians and the public in Tehran. It would not have to close any of its three nuclear facilities, though it would be left with only one that would enrich uranium \u2014 at levels low enough to create fuel for power plants but not high enough to create weapons-grade material.\n\nThe limitations would produce a one-year \u201cbreakout\u201d period, meaning it would take Iran a full year to build up enough material to build one nuclear warhead, compared with current estimates of two to three months, officials said.\n\nMany sanctions initially would be suspended, rather than lifted permanently as Iran sought, so they could be \u201csnapped back\u201d into place if Iran was discovered to be cheating, the officials said.\n\nIran\u2019s apparent acceptance of so many conditions sought by the United States could give the Obama administration a tool to fend off critics in Congress who want to impose new sanctions to wring more concessions from the Iranians.\n\nThe White House fears such steps could scuttle the talks and prompt Tehran to resume its nuclear program at full tilt. Iran claims its nuclear program is for peaceful, civilian uses.\n\nWhile the negotiations will continue through June, much of the attention will now shift to the White House and its defense of the negotiations, both in classified briefings to Congress and in public arenas.\n\nObama hailed the agreement as a \u201chistoric understanding\u201d and asked whether anyone really thinks that the deal is \u201ca worse option than the risk of another war in the Middle East.\u201d\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a persistent critic of the negotiations, told Obama by telephone that a final deal based on the parameters announced Thursday \u201cwould threaten the survival of Israel,\u201d according to an Israeli statement.\n\nKerry\u2019s predecessor at the State Department, Hillary Rodham Clinton, called the framework agreement an \u201cunderstanding,\u201d saying it was an \u201cimportant step toward a comprehensive agreement that would prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and strengthen the security of the United States, Israel, and the region.\u201d\n\nThe announcement of the agreement was made by weary-looking diplomats from Iran, the European Union, the United States and five other nations. Most had slept only one or two hours after the previous day\u2019s talks, which stretched nearly through the night.\n\nThey sounded exuberant even before they arrived at a Lausanne school a few miles from the hotel where the last rounds of talks had been held. Many diplomats had been cautious after the negotiations failed to meet a March 31 deadline. But once the bargaining ended Thursday, there was a flurry of excited tweets.\n\n\u201cBig day,\u201d wrote Kerry, who shouldered most of the direct negotiations with Iran.\n\nOnce the agreement was reached, the diplomats walked onto a stage bearing the flags of the nations involved in the talks \u2014 Iran, Germany, France, Britain, Russia, China and the United States.\n\nThen Mohammad Javad Zarif, Iran\u2019s foreign minister and chief negotiator in the talks, and the European foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, made statements.\n\nMogherini said Iran and the world powers were taking a \u201cdecisive step\u201d before she listed the main parameters for an eventual deal in which Iran would be permitted to pursue the civilian use of nuclear technology.\n\n[A step-by-step guide to what the Iran agreement actually means]\n\nUnder the agreement, Iran\u2019s heavy-water reactor in Arak would be rebuilt so it could not produce weapons-grade plutonium. No nuclear fuel would be reprocessed, and spent fuel would be exported or diluted.\n\nIran\u2019s underground plant at Fordow would be converted from a uranium-enrichment site into a nuclear physics and technology center. The site was built secretly deep inside a mountain near Qom and would be difficult to destroy by military attack.\n\nAs Mogherini was speaking, the State Department was\n\ne-mailing reporters a \u201cfact sheet\u201d outlining more details that it said Iran had agreed to, though it could not immediately be confirmed that Iran was indeed on board with every item.\n\nIn one of the most significant points, the number of Iran\u2019s centrifuges would be cut by two-thirds, to about 6,000, according to the statement. It said they would be first-generation machines, not the more advanced ones that Iran has sought. Keeping the old centrifuges is a key element in establishing the one-year breakout period, a red line for Washington.\n\nThe fact sheet said Iran further agreed not to enrich uranium above the level of 3.67\u00a0percent for at least 15 years. That level of low-enriched uranium is suitable as fuel for nuclear power plants but not as fissile material for nuclear weapons, which require uranium enriched to about 90\u00a0percent purity.\n\nIran has agreed to reduce its stockpile of about 10,000 kilograms (22,000 pounds) of low-enriched uranium to 300 kilograms (660 pounds) for 15 years, the fact sheet said.\n\nThe restrictions would be monitored through inspections conducted by the International Atomic Energy Agency, and some of them would last 25 years under the accord.\n\nZarif seemed to go out of his way to thank Kerry for investing so much time and effort in the negotiations, which he said had been conducted with \u201cmutual respect.\u201d\n\nThe preliminary agreement could foretell the beginning of a new chapter in Iran\u2019s relationship with the world, and particularly the United States.\n\nThough six nations negotiated with Iran, much of the heavy lifting was done in meetings between the United States and Iran. The countries have been hostile toward each other for decades, particularly since the 1979 revolution and the seizure of dozens of American diplomats who were held hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Tehran.\n\nBut the United States and Iran will remain at odds on many issues.\n\n\u201cWe have serious differences with the United States,\u201d Zarif said. \u201cWe have built mutual distrust in the past. .\u2009.\u2009. So what I hope is that through courageous implementation of this, some of that trust could be remedied. But that is for us all to wait and see.\u201d\n\nWilliam Branigin in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nThe key moments in the long history of U.S.-Iran tensions\n\nTranscript: Iranian Foreign Minister Zarif on the \u2018framework\u2019 for a nuclear deal\n\nAnother nation blazed the trail for Iran in developing a nuclear program", "167": "  Big pharmaceutical companies don\u2019t want you to know that some of the artificial medication for constipation significantly reduce the effectiveness of the intestines. As a result, some people report that without taking certain medication, they can\u2019t visit the toilet. The good news is, you can solve constipation quite easily. But let\u2019s delve deeply into what constipation can do to the body first. Bad Breath Firstly, constipation can cause bad breath (halitosis). Unfortunately, people who suffer from bad breath don\u2019t always realize that they have a problem. People are unlikely to point out to a person that their breath stinks; therefore, they might miss out on social events and job opportunities due to bad breath. Constipation can cause bad breath because there is a build up of toxic waste and the gasses rise up through the body. Rectal Issues & Infection As stools spend more time in the bowels, water is reabsorbed. As a result, stools get hard and dry. Some constipation suffers report that passing bowels becomes very painful and can take many hours. As a result, the rectum is stretched beyond its limits. This can lead to rectal prolapse, which is a rectum which fails to close. Rectal prolapse sufferers usually wear diapers because stool leaks out of them. Moreover, they are more prone to infection. Increase Toxins The skin is the largest organ in the body and is a reflection of a person\u2019s general health. Constipation typically increases the buildup of toxins in the body. As a result, the skin has to work harder to eliminate toxins. This can cause acne, skin discoloration etc. Therefore, if your skin is bad, don\u2019t buy an expensive beauty product. Take a look at your diet, and whether you suffer from constipation. The skin is a reflection of inner health.   Colon Cancer Constipation can also cause colon cancer. The colon is designed to hold a few pounds of stools. Think of it like a plastic bag. Overload with heavy items and it rips. It\u2019s primary function is to transport stool. However, when an individual is constipated, it has to store stool. This puts a strain on the inner membrane and can cause ruptures and internal infections. Invasive surgery may be required in such instances. Loss Of Healthy Bacteria The intestines contain flora (healthy bacteria) which help with immunity and vitamin production. Constipation reduces the concentration of flora, thereby leaving sufferers more susceptible to infection and illness. Moreover, they help to keep stools soft. Therefore, constipation sufferers can go through a downward spiral whereby their condition worsens over time. As people age, they are more likely to get constipated. Moreover, it is more likely to have a serious effect on their health. This is because the body isn\u2019t as resilient. Notably, constipation can have a big effect on quality of life; especially if it comes with one of the serious conditions above. Fortunately, there is a natural cure. Sufferers no longer have to be on a path to deteriorating health. What You Can Do A majority of constipation medication are filled with chemicals which can harm the body, and make constipation worse. Even a product like Metamucil contains ingredients no person should consume, like aspartame. Change your diet! This is one of the best ways to end constipation. Eat plenty of healthy fruits and vegetables and cut out processed foods as much as you can. Eating rancid fats (cooked meat) also doesn\u2019t help with constipation and your digestive system so limiting that as much as possible is important. There are also some great products on the market that can assist you in ending constipation while you spend time changing your diet over time. Wholey Shit is a great example as it contains only a few natural, high quality ingredients -and it works great! You can get a free sample of Wholey Shit here. These types of remedies are a great way to get started and relief naturally and quickly while you further discover how to adjust your diet and lifestyle to reflect better digestion, eating habits and so forth. \nThe Sacred Science follows eight people from around the world, with varying physical and psychological illnesses, as they embark on a one-month healing journey into the heart of the Amazon jungle. \nYou can watch this documentary film FREE for 10 days by clicking here. \n\"If \u201cSurvivor\u201d was actually real and had stakes worth caring about, it would be what happens here, and \u201cThe Sacred Science\u201d hopefully is merely one in a long line of exciting endeavors from this group.\" - Billy Okeefe, McClatchy Tribune", "168": "ARJUN WALIA OCTOBER 18, 2016 Tensions between the United States, their allies, and Russia continue to rise. It seems, as always, that we are on the brink of global war. The Western military industrial complex continues to take over the Middle East and arm ISIS and other terrorist groups, as well as establish and solidify their military presence throughout the world. The sheer number of United States military bases around the globe is astonishing. \nFor more, unbiased information on the current state of affairs between the United States and Russia, I recommend visiting theantimedia.org. \nMainstream media outlets continue to spread propaganda , and have been doing so for years, claiming that there are terrorists, that they threaten national security, and that we must go after them. At the same time, an inflated sense of patriotism is encouraged in American citizens, so they believe their soldiers are fighting for freedom, despite doing the precise opposite. \nA great quote by Edward Bernays, who was known as the father of public relations, comes to mind here: \nThe conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society . Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. ( source ) \nA number of politicians and academics from around the world have been trying to create awareness on this issue for decades, and although we\u2019ve come a long way, our relatively slow progress demonstrates the stranglehold mainstream media has on the minds of the masses. \n\u201cThe statesmen will invent cheap lies, putting the blame upon the nation that is attacked, and every man will be glad of those conscience-soothing falsities, and will diligently study them, and refuse to examine any refutations of them; and thus he will by and by convince himself the war is just, and will thank God for the better sleep he enjoys after this process of grotesque self-deception.\u201d \n\u2013 Mark Twain ( source ) \nBelow, you\u2019ll find 15 quotes on false flag terrorism and the secret government. False flag terrorism refers to the idea that terrorist attacks are created, perpetuated, and/or funded by Western governments and their allies in order to justify the infiltration of other countries for ulterior motives. Quotes on False Flag Terrorism and the Secret Government \n1. The Dalia Lama \n\u201cOf course, war and the large military establishments are the greatest sources of violence in the world. Whether their purpose is defensive or offensive, these vast powerful organizations exist solely to kill human beings. We should think carefully about the reality of war. Most of us have been conditioned to regard military combat as exciting and glamorous \u2013 an opportunity for men to prove their competence and courage. Since armies are legal, we feel that war is acceptable; in general, nobody feels that war is criminal or that accepting it is criminal attitude. In fact, we have been brainwashed. War is neither glamorous nor attractive. It is monstrous. Its very nature is one of tragedy and suffering.\u201d \n\u201cModern warfare waged primarily with different forms of fire, but we are so conditioned to see it as thrilling that we talk about this or that marvelous weapon as a remarkable piece of technology without remembering that, if it is actually used, it will burn living people. War also strongly resembles a fire in the way it spreads. If one area gets weak, the commanding officer sends in reinforcements. This is throwing live people onto a fire. But because we have been brainwashed to think this way, we do not consider the suffering of individual soldiers. No soldiers want to be wounded or die. None of his loved ones wants any harm to come to him. If one soldier is killed, or maimed for life, at least another five or ten people \u2013 his relatives and friends \u2013 suffer as well. We should all be horrified by the extent of this tragedy, but we are too confused.\u201d \n\u201cBut no matter how malevolent or evil are the many murderous dictators who can currently oppress their nations and cause international problems, it is obvious that they cannot harm others or destroy countless human lives if they don\u2019t have a military organisation accepted and condoned by society.\u201d ( source ) \n2. Dr. Michel Chossudovsky, Canadian economist, the University of Ottawa\u2019s Emeritus Professor of Economics \n\u201cWe are dealing with a criminal undertaking at a global level . . . and there is an ongoing war, it is led by the United States, it may be carried out by a number of proxy countries, which are obeying orders from Washington . . . The global war on terrorism is a US undertaking, which is fake, it\u2019s based on fake premises. It tells us that somehow America and the Western world are going after a fictitious enemy, the Islamic state, when in fact the Islamic state is fully supported and financed by the Western military alliance and America\u2019s allies in the Persian Gulf. . . . They say Muslims are terrorists, but it just so happens that terrorists are Made in America. They\u2019re not the product of Muslim society, and that should be abundantly clear to everyone on this floor. . . . The global war on terrorism is a fabrication, a big lie and a crime against humanity.\u201d \n\u201cAl Qaeda and the Al Qaeda affiliated organizations, including the Islamic State, are not independent organizations, they are sponsored, and they are sponsored by the United States and its allies. It is documented that prior to 2011, there was a process of recruitment of mujahideen to fight in Syria, and this was coordinated by NATO and the Turkish high command. This report is confirmed by Israeli news sources and unequivocally, we are dealing with a state-sponsorship of terrorism, the recruitment of mercenaries, the training and the financing of terrorism.\u201d ( source )( source ) \n3. Paul Hellyer \n\u201cIt is ironic that the U.S. would begin a devastating war, allegedly in search of weapons of mass destruction, when the most worrisome developments in this field are occurring in your own backyard. It is ironic that the U.S. should be fighting monstrously expensive wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, allegedly to bring democracy to those countries, when it itself can no longer claim to be called a democracy, when trillions, and I mean thousands of billions of dollars have been spent on projects about which both the Congress and the Commander in Chief have been kept deliberately in the dark.\u201d ( source ) \n4. John C.

Robin Cook, Former British Foreign Secretary \n\u201cThe truth is, there is no Islamic army or terrorist group called Al-Qaeda, and any informed intelligence officer knows this. But, there is a propaganda campaign to make the public believe in the presence of an intensified entity representing the \u2018devil\u2019 only in order to drive TV watchers to accept a unified international leadership for a war against terrorism. The country behind this propaganda is the United States.\u201d ( source ) \n6. John F. Hylan, Mayor of New York City from 1918-1925 \n\u201cThe real menace of our Republic is the invisible government, which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy legs over our cities, states and nation . . . The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government for their own selfish purposes. They practically control both parties . . . [and] control the majority of the newspapers and magazines in this country. They use the columns of these papers to club into submission or drive out of office public officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliques which compose the invisible government.

Senator Daniel K. Inouye, highest ranking Asian-American politician in United States history \n\u201cThere exists a shadowy government with its own Air Force, its own Navy, its own fundraising mechanism, and the ability to pursue its own ideas of the national interest, free from all checks and balances, and free from the law itself.\u201d ( source ) \n8. David Steele, the second-highest ranking civilian in the U.S. Marine Corps Intelligence and a former CIA clandestine services officer \n\u201cMost terrorists are false flag terrorists, or are created by our own security services. In the United States, every single terrorist incident we have had has been a false flag, or has been an informant pushed on by the FBI. In fact, we now have citizens taking out restraining orders against FBI informants that are trying to incite terrorism. We\u2019ve become a lunatic asylum.\u201d ( source ) \n9. Theodore Roosevelt. former President of the United States \n\u201cPolitical parties exist to secure responsible government and to execute the will of the people. \nFrom these great tasks both of the old parties have turned aside. Instead of instruments to promote the general welfare, they have become the tools of corrupt interests which use them impartially to serve their selfish purposes. Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government, owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. \nTo destroy this invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.\u201d ( source ) \n10.

It is practically irremovable.\u201d ( source ) \n12. Woodrow Wilson, former President of the United States \n\u201cSince I entered politics, I have chiefly had men\u2019s views confided to me privately. Some of the biggest men in the United States, in the field of commerce and manufacture, are afraid of something. They know that there is a power somewhere so organized, so subtle, so watchful, so interlocked, so complete, so pervasive, that they better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it.\u201d ( source ) \n13. Eric H. May, a former U.S. Army military intelligence and public affairs officer \n\u201cThe easiest way to carry out a false flag attack is by setting up a military exercise that simulates the very attack you want to carry out. As I\u2019ll detail below, this is exactly how government perpetrators in the US and UK handled the 9/11 and 7/7 \u201cterror\u201d attacks, which were in reality government attacks blamed on \u2018terrorists.\u2019 \u201d ( source ) \n14. Professor Lance deHaven-Smith, Professor Emeritus of Public Administration and Policy, Florida State University \n\u201cSCADs [which refers to State Crimes Against Democracy] involve high-level government officials, often in combination with private interests, that engage in covert activities for political advantages and power.\u201d ( source )( source ) \n15. President John F. Kennedy \n\u201cThe very word \u2018secrecy\u2019 is repugnant in a free and open society; and we are as a people inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweighed the dangers which are cited to justify it. Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in insuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning to the very limits of official censorship and concealment. That I do not intend to permit to the extent that it is in my control. . . . \nFor we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence\u2013on infiltration instead of invasion, on subversion instead of elections, on intimidation instead of free choice, on guerrillas by night instead of armies by day. It is a system which has conscripted vast human and material resources into the building of a tightly knit, highly efficient machine that combines military, diplomatic, intelligence, economic, scientific and political operations. \nIts preparations are concealed, not published. Its mistakes are buried, not headlined. Its dissenters are silenced, not praised. No expenditure is questioned, no rumor is printed, no secret is revealed.\u201d ( source ) Share:", "169": "Something interesting happened for Hillary Clinton in the third quarter of fundraising: Her fundraising centers softened.\n\nDuring the second quarter, Clinton outraised Bernie Sanders handily, thanks to a lot of big-dollar donors. In the third quarter, the two were about tied. But look at how Clinton's donors were arrayed during the third quarter versus the second.\n\nIn the second quarter, Clinton received donations from about 5,300 ZIP codes. In the third quarter, that increased to 6,300.\n\nThat second quarter, when Clinton wrung a lot of money out of a lot of people, she pulled in a lot of money from Manhattan's wealthiest ZIP codes. In those ZIPs, roughly 10021 through 10028, Clinton raised $2 million from individuals in the second quarter. In the third quarter, she raised $725,000 -- a $1.3 million drop.

Syrian War Report \u2013 November 2, 2016: ISIS and Al-Nusra Attempt to Cut Off Govt Supply Line to Aleppo By South Front on November 2, 2016 \u2026from SouthFront \nThe Syrian Air Force has delivered a high number of air strikes in western Aleppo, targeting militants in in Al-Assad, Rashidin 4, Rashidin 5, the 1070 Apartment Project (1070 AP), Southern Sawmills and along the road to Khan Tuman. \nSince November 1, the fighting in the area has become stationary. The western part of the al-Assad Neighborhood is contested. The al-Nusra led coalition, Jaish al-Fatah, controls the southwestern part of the 1070 AP. The militants\u2019 attacks on the 3000 Apartment Project have failed. \nIn the 1070 AP, the government forces keep control of 3 groups of buildings. The supply line #1 has been cut off by Jaish al-Fatah. The supply line #2 is vulnerable to fire by militants. The government-controlled sector is separated from Jaish al-Fatah units by an open ground. This is why the militants are not able to take control of these building blocks. \nClashes in this non-populated area allow the Syrian military to use its advantage in firepower to whittle the jihadist manpower and military equipment, repelling their frontal attacks. Jaish al-Fatah suicide vehicle-borne improvised explosive devices remain the main threat to the army\u2019s defenses. \nWhile Jaish al-Fatah cannot take control of the 1070 AP, the alliance\u2019s attacks on the 3000 Apartment Project will hardly be able to lead to any success. \nSyrian troops have repelled an ISIS attack on the government only supply line to Aleppo in the sector between Ithriyah and al-Salamiyah. ISIS attacked the Syrian army in the Wadi al-Adhib region but was forced to retreat after a fierce battle. Last weekend, al-Nusra Front, the leading force of Jaish al-Fatah, attacked the supply line in the sector between Ithriyah and Aleppo, but also failed. \nThis clearly shows that despite all controversies, ISIS and the so-called \u2018moderate opposition\u2019 are playing in the same game, attempting to prevent liberation of Aleppo by the government forces. \nTurkey\u2019s engineer units are currently building a military base, with an airfield, in the area of Ziyar, south of the Syrian border town of al-Rai, the As Safir newspaper revealed. The newspaper believes that the Turkish regime is going implement the Iraq-like strategy in Syria and set a series of military installations in order to project the military power in the area. \nOn November 1, Iraqi security forces (ISF) liberated the strategic Kurdish village of Gogjali in the eastern outskirts of Mosul and seized the nearby state-TV building. By doing this, the ISF has entered the ISIS-controlled city for the first time since it was occupied by ISIS in 2014.

Some view dressing up, eating candy and enjoying the festivities harmless and innocent, while others view it as an offense to their faith. Americans spend nearly $6.9 billion yearly making it the second largest commercial holiday in the country. As commercialized as the celebration has become, many of its roots are completely paganist. Is this a cause for Christians to avoid the entire celebration?\nThis is a time of year filled with debate, but not necessarily politics. Many Christians are convinced that Halloween is a satanic holiday while the rest of the world has found their sweet spot complete with costumes and candy. Children and adults have the opportunity to dress in accordance with their imagination, confirming from its haunted history to modern festivities, this holiday is a big deal. With decorations, candy, parties, and costumes, the average American spends up to $75 in the spirit of celebration.\nHalloween is the holiday that links the seasons of fall and winter. Reportedly, it originated with one of the ancient Celtic festivals; an event where people would wear various costumes and light bonfires in hopes of warding off roaming ghosts. However, by the late 1800s, Americans shifted the theory of Halloween into a holiday centered on community and fun events. The focus, for many, has transitioned from witchcraft and ghosts to neighborhood celebratory events. With the evolving of the focal point, should Christians change their stance to celebrate the holiday?\nDespite having at least partial roots from a Christian tradition, the relationship between Halloween and Christians has long been complicated. On October 31, 1517, Martin Luther essentially started the Protestant Reformation in Wittenberg, Germany, when he nailed his 95 Theses to a door. Many of the early Christian groups that came to America rejected this holiday as pagan. The Protestant Reformation heavily influenced the Pilgrims, Puritans, Quakers, and Baptists causing the great majority to frown upon it. However, that did not prevent Halloween from finding its way to American shores.\nIn the eighth century, Pope Gregory III dedicated November 1 as a time to honor all saints and martyrs. The holiday became widely recognized as All Saints\u2019 Day. The evening before was known as All Hallows\u2019 Eve, which later became Halloween. The word \u201challow\u201d originated from the Old English word for \u201choly\u201d and \u201ce\u2019en\u201d is an abbreviation of \u201cevening.\u201d As such, Halloween represented the night before All Saints Day.\nOver time, Halloween advanced into a secular, community-based holiday branded by child-friendly activities that include costumes, neighborhood trick-or-treating, and more recently, trunk-or-treating. Along with a variety of pumpkin-flavored foods, Parties for both children and adults have become a very common way to celebrate the holiday. Some Christians still choose to lock themselves indoors with the lights off, but others have found freedom in their faith and are at liberty to decide when and how to participate.\nIn multiple countries around the world, as the days grow shorter and the nights get colder, people continue to escort the winter season in with candy-coated gatherings and a wide range of costumes. Halloween is a celebration that allows people of all ages to participate. Nonetheless, the question remains, \u201cShould Christians celebrate?\u201d\nDue to the efforts of community leaders and parents, Halloween has lost most of its illogical and religious undertones and is now more about imagination than spooky interpretation. There is nothing sinful about a Christian dressing up and participating in fun, non-threatening, celebrations. As a result, many Christians find no harm in dressing in costumes, attending parties and festivals as well as allowing their children to participate in school and local activities.\nBy Cherese Jackson (Virginia)\nSources:\nHistory: Halloween\nKidsville News: Around the World \u2013 October 2015\nGrace to You: Christians and Halloween\nPhoto Credits:\nTop Image Courtesy of Billy Wilson \u2013 Flickr License\nInline Image (1) Courtesy of Richard Vignola \u2013 Flickr License\nInline Image (2) Courtesy of The Forum News \u2013 Flickr License\nFeatured Image Courtesy of John Nakamura \u2013 Flickr License christianity , halloween", "176": "(CNN) The site of a horrific mass killing will become a house of worship again.\n\nEmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, will hold a service at 9:30 a.m. Sunday, according to CNN affiliate WCSC.\n\nNine people were shot to death Wednesday night at the church.\n\nAuthorities said Dylann Roof, 21, of Lexington, South Carolina, admits he shot and killed the people he'd sat with for Bible study at the historicall y black church, two law enforcement officials said.\n\nRoof is white and all the victims are black. He told investigators he did it to start a race war, according to one of the officials.\n\nThe church premises remained a crime scene, and thus off-limits to church members, until Charleston police released it Saturday.\n\nOne of the victims was the church's pastor, the Rev. Clementa Pinckney. The Rev. Norvel Goff, presiding elder of Emanuel AME, told CNN he will give the sermon at the service.\n\nCharleston, nicknamed the Holy City because it has so many churches, will remember the shooting victims in other ways.\n\nOn Sunday night, a unity chain will be held on the 13,200-foot-long Arthur Ravenel Jr. Bridge. Organizers hope to attract enough people to hold hands and stretch from Charleston to the town of Mount Pleasant on the other side of the Cooper River.\n\nThat message was echoed by Arthur Hurd, the husband of victim Cynthia Hurd. He's in the Merchant Marines and arrived in Charleston on Saturday.\n\n'Hate's not in me'\n\n\"This is all surreal but what I can say to that young man is that in time I will forgive you,\" Hurd told CNN affiliate WCIV. \"I won't move past this but I will forgive you. But I hope for the rest of your life, however long or short that may be, you stop and play that tape over and over and over again in your head and see the sheer terror and pain you put purely innocent people through. ...\"\n\n\"I would love to hate you but hate's not in me. If I hate you I'm no better than you.\"\n\nPeople angry about the killings took to the streets Saturday.\n\nIn Charleston, hundreds joined the March for Black Lives.\n\nThe group began the march in total silence as they walked to Emanuel AME Church from a nearby park, stopping outside the church to lay flowers at the makeshift memorial.\n\nOnce they passed the church, the group filled Charleston's iconic King Street, usually packed with tourists this time of year. Many carried signs of support for the victims of the Charleston shooting and the black community: \"STILL WE RISE,\" \"Hand in Hand,\" \"Do the right thing,\" \"Black Lives Matter,\" signs read.\n\nThe march ended with a rally outside the historic Daughters of the Confederacy building.\n\n'Take it down'\n\n\"That terrorist did not win. He wanted to invoke terror and fear in our community, but we are not for that,\" an organizer said to the crowd. \"We are standing up together, arm in arm... We will not bow down, but we will stand up.\"\n\nDespite the sweltering heat, a large crowd filled the front grounds of the South Carolina Capitol in Columbia calling for the Confederate flag to be removed.\n\n\"Take it down, take it down,\" chanted the crowd filled with people of all races and ages holding signs.\n\nOne woman's sign said, \"Love breeds love, hate breeds hate\" and another man's sign says, \"Remove my ancestors sign.\"\n\nOrganizers of the event, the South Carolina Progressive Network, estimates between 1,500 and 1,700 people attended.\n\nThe 2,000-word text explains the writer's philosophy of white superiority, saying the Trayvon Martin case \"truly awakened me\" and that \"I chose Charleston because it is most historic city in my state, and at one time had the highest ratio of blacks to Whites in the country.\"\n\nMotive has become the biggest question as state and federal investigators work on the case -- and statements and photos on the website match what investigators have determined so far.\n\nFor instance, CNN Charlotte affiliate WBTV, citing a source, says Roof told investigators in Shelby, North Carolina, where he was arrested, that he researched the church and targeted it because it turned out to be a \"historic African-American church.\"\n\nThree photos show Roof posing with a pistol. One closeup shows a gun that can be identified as a.45-caliber Glock -- the model of gun investigators say was used in the church shooting. Those photos were taken in April, after his 21st birthday, when his family said he purchased a .45-caliber gun.\n\nThe website, called the Last Rhodesian, is bare bones. Roof's name doesn't appear anywhere on the site but he is shown in many of the photos. An Internet ownership search shows the website was registered to Roof and listed as the administrator.\n\nWhile the nation rallies behind Charleston, an insight into Roof's state of mind came from Charleston County Sheriff's Office spokesman Maj. Eric Watson.\n\nRoof, he said, \"is in protective custody. He is currently sitting on his bed being monitored by two detention officers. He is on suicide watch.\"\n\nRoof may be prosecuted by federal authorities if it's determined he committed a hate crime. The Justice Department said \"it is looking at this crime from all angles, including as a hate crime and as an act of domestic terrorism.\"\n\nFuneral plans for Pinckney, who was a state senator, were announced Saturday.\n\nPinckney's casket will be at the State House rotunda lobby from 1-5 p.m. Wednesday. Public viewings will also be held Thursday at St. John AMC Church in Ridgeland and Emanuel AME Church.\n\nThe funeral will be held at 11 a.m. Friday at TD Arena on the College of Charleston campus.

With Barack Obama halfway out the door and Clinton all but crowned, Washington\u2019s laptop bombardiers are rejoicing that the half-measures are over and judgment day nearly at hand. Samantha Power, Permanent Representative of the United States to the UN, addresses the Security Council meeting on Syria, Sept. 25, 2016. Power has been an advocate for escalating U.S. military involvement in Syria. (UN Photo) \nThus, The New York Times assures us that that the Middle East is \u201cdesperate for American leadership\u201d while the Washington Post reports that \u201cthe Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the ground work for a more assertive American foreign policy.\u201d \nLeading think tanks are publishing \u201ca flurry of reports\u201d urging stepped-up intervention, including U.S.-backed \u201csafe zones to protect moderate rebels from Syrian and Russian forces\u201d and even \u201climited\u201d cruise-missile strikes. But while differing on the details, all agree something must be done. The time to act is now. \nAs Vox puts it: \u201cThe hot new policy idea in Washington is the hottest old idea: direct US military intervention in Syria\u2019s civil war.\u201d \nBut reading between the lines, a very different picture emerges, a realization that the U.S. has painted itself into a corner and that there is little it can do after all. Thus, the Times observes that while the Middle East is clamoring for U.S. leadership, it is not clamoring for Bush-style intervention but for some mythical \u201cmiddle ground\u201d in between him and Obama. \nWhile reporting that pro-escalation sentiment is unanimous in Washington\u2019s vast foreign-policy establishment \u2013 sometimes known as \u201c the blob \u201d \u2013 the Washington Post notes that \u201ceven pinprick cruise-missile strikes designed to hobble the Syrian air force or punish [President Bashar al-]Assad would risk a direct confrontation with Russian forces\u201d and wonders whether a war-weary public will support any intervention at all. \n\u201cMy concern is that we may be talking to each other and agreeing with each other,\u201d it quotes one expert as saying, \u201cbut that these discussions are isolated from where the public may be right now.\u201d \nOfficial Washington in a Bubble \nThus, even the Establishment worries that it lives in a bubble. Washington wants war, it needs war, and yet it admits in practically the same breath that it can\u2019t have it. So what will it do? A heart-rending propaganda image designed to justify a major U.S. military operation inside Syria against the Syrian military. \nThen there are the mild liberals over at Vox, the hip and successful Washington website founded by journalistic wunderkind Ezra Klein. Voxers pride themselves on being sharp and practical yet in the end they are sealed off as well. The poster boy for this tendency is Zack Beauchamp, a young writer who stars in a recent Vox video entitled, \u201c The crisis in Aleppo, explained in 4 minutes .\u201d \nAs Beauchamp lectures away amid fancy graphics and cool background music, the video faithfully toes the Washington line, both the stirring gung-ho part and the downbeat refrain that inevitably follows. Thus, he describes the Syrian civil war as a \u201cstory of flip-flops,\u201d with Assad seemingly on the ropes until Iran and Russia put him back on his feet, at which point the Saudis and Qataris put the rebels back on their feet so the game can continue. \nBut the real turning point, he says, occurred in September 2015 when Russia stepped in with airstrikes that allowed the government to besiege the Salafists in eastern Aleppo. \n\u201cA siege,\u201d Beauchamp then explains, \u201cinvolves trapping a group of people, civilians and fighters both, inside a certain territory and denying them supplies until they can no longer fight. Assad\u2019s strategy has a vicious logic to it. When you deprive people of food and you bomb them over and over again, they\u2019re likely to give in just to make the fighting stop.\u201d \nThe upshot, he says, is \u201ca humanitarian crisis \u2026 roughly 250,000 people trapped in the city \u2026 running dangerously low on supplies, access to clean water and medicine.\u201d So what should the U.S. do in response? The video\u2019s tone at this point turns pessimistic and then pitch black: \n\u201cThe United States has the military power to break the siege of Aleppo,\u201d Beauchamp says, \u201cbut doing so would be extremely dangerous. For one thing, it would need to coordinate with rebels on the ground, some of whom are extremists. For another, it means that the US would be operating in hostile air space with Russian planes.If the US were to engage with Russian planes, that could theoretically mean direct fire between two nuclear-armed superpowers, a risk that very few people in the United States are willing to take. And three, even if the US did temporarily break the siege, it would have to maintain a commitment to insure that things didn\u2019t get worse. That could mean an open-ended war. And there\u2019s no guarantee that this would make anything better, but, rather, it might just get more people killed over the long run.\u201d \nSo U.S. options are zero: \u201cEvery diplomatic solution tried so far has failed, and failed miserably, and there\u2019s simply no economic tool that can be used to end the fighting or ease the suffering of the people inside besieged territories. There\u2019s no good answer. There\u2019s nothing that anyone has that could simply solve the crisis. It\u2019s a disaster and a disaster without any end in sight.\u201d \nFalsehoods and Obfuscations \nBeauchamp\u2019s explanation \u2013 which is really not an explanation at all, merely an assertion \u2013 is studded with falsehoods and obfuscations. By describing Assad\u2019s strategy as uniquely \u201cvicious,\u201d he ignores obvious parallels between the Russian air campaign in Aleppo and U.S. air assaults on Fallujah , Tikrit , and Ramadi , all in central Iraq and all largely destroyed in the course of \u201cliberating\u201d them from ISIS. U.S.-backed Syrian \u201cmoderate\u201d rebels smile as they prepare to behead a 12-year-old boy (left), whose severed head is held aloft triumphantly in a later part of the video. [Screenshot from the YouTube video] By referring to the events in Syria as a civil war, he fails to acknowledge the degree to which it is actually a foreign invasion by the U.S., Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and other Persian Gulf states. By repeatedly referring to the Salafists as \u201crebels\u201d \u2013 which suggests that they are Syrians rising up from within \u2013 he ignores the fact that large numbers \u2013 36,500, according to Director of National Intelligence James Clapper \u2013 are foreign-born.\nWhile asserting that 250,000 people are trapped inside east Aleppo, he ignores reports that the real figure is far lower. The Guardian \u2019s Martin Chulov, for example, estimated in March 2015 that only 40,000 people remained in rebel-held areas while Vice News reported last July that \u201cmost of Aleppo\u2019s residents have fled the city. There are just a handful of civilians and rebel fighters holding on in the shattered ruins.\u201d \nBeauchamp also implies that it is the government that has \u201ctrapped\u201d people in east Aleppo when reports in the London Independent and elsewhere indicate that Salafists are firing on anyone trying to take the government up on its offer of safe passage. While acknowledging that \u201csome\u201d fighters are \u201cextremists,\u201d he ignores the fact that the U.S. military has admitted that Al Nusra, the local branch of Al Qaeda, is firmly in charge. \nWhen Salafists launched a short-lived offensive in east Aleppo last summer, for instance, The New York Times reported that they named it in honor of Ibrahim al-Yousef, a Muslim Brotherhood member who led a horrendous massacre of Alawite military cadets in 1979. It was indicative of how anti-Alawite sectarianism of the most bloodthirsty sort is the common denominator underlying all anti-government factions. \nOne could go on, but the point is clear. The foreign-policy establishment has not only cut itself off from the public but, with the help of sympathetic media outlets like Vox, has cut itself off from its own intellectual history. Incapable of examining the U.S. role in the Syrian debacle in an honest and straightforward way, it can only blunder about in the dark, staggering backward or forward as circumstances dictate. Now seems to be the moment when it is poised between the two. \nSo how will the United States respond now that Washington is preparing for a transition between Obama-style abstention and Hillary-style neo-conservatism? Here\u2019s is one reporter\u2019s modest attempt at reading the tea leaves: \nWashington will continue to fume as the catastrophe deepens in both Syria and Iraq. As the drive to push ISIS (also known as ISIL, Islamic State, and Daesh) out of Mosul in northern Iraq degenerates into ethno-sectarian warfare among Turks, Sunni Arabs, Shi\u2018ites, and Kurds, the drive to take back Raqqa, ISIS\u2019s capital in north-central Syria will similarly falter as fighting breaks out between pro-Turkish forces and Kurdish People\u2019s Protection Units, or YPG. \nThe fall of east Aleppo, which now seems to be a foregone conclusion, will drive the foreign-policy establishment to a fury. Obama may be able to hold the hawks off. But by the time he leaves office, \u201cthe blob\u201d will be in an uproar and demanding that something be done. Map of Syria. \nWith that, Zack Beauchamp will star in another Vox video entitled, \u201cU.S. military intervention in Syria, explained in 4 minutes.\u201d In it, he\u2019ll tell how Russian atrocities in Aleppo, plus backhanded Syrian government support for ISIS, leave the U.S. no choice but to launch a swarm of cruise missiles at Syrian military facilities. \nWhen Russian soldiers are killed, he\u2019ll try to shift blame to Vladimir Putin for stirring up trouble in the eastern Ukraine or the Baltics. He\u2019ll note that dissent is limited to a few cranky websites and far-left groups, all of which can be safely ignored since they\u2019re not part of the mainstream. Russia will then counter-attack, leading to \u2026 no one knows. \nWhile anything can go wrong with this scenario, one thing is clear. The mood in Official Washington is the opposite of 2003 when all the \u201cexperts\u201d agreed that an invasion of Iraq would be a walk in the park. Now they\u2019re filled with trepidation. But they\u2019re still trying to talk themselves into an escalation and may succeed.

He spoke from his big heart about our party's commitment to working people, as only he can do.\n\nAnd first lady Michelle Obama reminded us that our children are watching, and the president we elect is going to be their president, too.\n\nAnd for those of you out there who are just getting to know Tim Kaine \u2014 you will soon understand why the people of Virginia keep promoting him: from city council and mayor, to governor, and now senator.\n\nAnd he will make the whole country proud as our vice president.\n\nAnd ...

Your cause is our cause.\n\nOur country needs your ideas, energy and passion.\n\nThat is the only way we can turn our progressive platform into real change for America.\n\nWe wrote it together \u2014 now let's go out and make it happen together.\n\nMy friends, we've come to Philadelphia \u2014 the birthplace of our nation \u2014 because what happened in this city 240 years ago still has something to teach us today.\n\nWe all know the story. But we usually focus on how it turned out \u2014 and not enough on how close that story came to never being written at all.\n\nWhen representatives from 13 unruly colonies met just down the road from here, some wanted to stick with the king. And some wanted to stick it to the king.\n\nThe revolution hung in the balance.\n\nThen somehow, they began listening to each other, compromising, finding common purpose.\n\nAnd by the time they left Philadelphia, they had begun to see themselves as one nation.\n\nThat's what made it possible to stand up to a king.\n\nThat took courage. They had courage.\n\nOur Founders embraced the enduring truth that we are stronger together.\n\nNow, now America is once again at a moment of reckoning. Powerful forces are threatening to pull us apart. Bonds of trust and respect are fraying.\n\nAnd just as with our founders, there are no guarantees. It truly is up to us. We have to decide whether we all will work together so we can all rise together.\n\nOur country's motto is \"e pluribus unum\": out of many, we are one. Will we stay true to that motto?\n\nWell, we heard Donald Trump's answer last week at his convention. He wants to divide us from the rest of the world, and from each other.\n\nHe's betting that the perils of today's world will blind us to its unlimited promise. He's taken the Republican Party a long way from \"Morning in America\" to \"Midnight in America.\" He wants us to fear the future and fear each other.\n\nWell, you know, a great Democratic President Franklin Delano Roosevelt came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than 80 years ago, during a much more perilous time: \"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.\"\n\nNow we are clear-eyed about what our country is up against. But we are not afraid. We will rise to the challenge, just as we always have. We will not build a wall. Instead, we will build an economy where everyone who wants a good job can get one.\n\nAnd we'll build a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants who are already contributing to our economy!\n\nWe, we will not ban a religion. We will work with all Americans and our allies to fight and defeat terrorism.\n\nThere's a lot of work to do.\n\nToo many people haven't had a pay raise since the crash.\n\nThere's too much inequality. Too little social mobility. Too much paralysis in Washington. Too many threats at home and abroad.\n\nBut just look for a minute at the strengths we bring as Americans to meet these challenges. We have the most dynamic and diverse people in the world. We have the most tolerant and generous young people we've ever had. We have the most powerful military. The most innovative entrepreneurs. The most enduring values: freedom and equality, justice and opportunity.\n\nWe should be so proud that those words are associated with us. I have to tell you, as your secretary of state, I went to 112 countries. When people hear those words, they hear America.\n\nSo don't let anyone tell you that our country is weak. We're not.\n\nDon't let anyone tell you we don't have what it takes. We do.\n\nAnd most of all, don't believe anyone who says, \"I alone can fix it.\"\n\nYes, those were actually Donald Trump's words in Cleveland. And they should set off alarm bells for all of us.\n\nReally? I alone can fix it? Isn't he forgetting?\n\nTroops on the front lines. Police officers and firefighters who run toward danger. Doctors and nurses who care for us. Teachers who change lives. Entrepreneurs who see possibilities in every problem. Mothers who lost children to violence and are building a movement to keep other kids safe.\n\nHe's forgetting every last one of us.\n\nAmericans don't say, \"I alone can fix it.\" We say, \"We'll fix it together.\"\n\nAnd remember, remember: Our Founders fought a revolution and wrote a Constitution so America would never be a nation where one person had all the power. Two-hundred-and-forty years later, we still put our faith in each other.\n\nLook at what happened in Dallas after the assassinations of five brave police officers. Police Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them.\n\nAnd you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days.\n\nThat's how Americans answer when the call for help goes out.\n\nTwenty years ago, I wrote a book called It Takes a Village. And a lot of people looked at the title and asked, \"What the heck do you mean by that?\"\n\nThis is what I mean. None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.\n\nAmerica needs every one of us to lend our energy, our talents, our ambition to making our nation better and stronger. I believe that with all my heart.\n\nThat's why \"Stronger Together\" is not just a lesson from our history. It's not just a slogan for our campaign.\n\nIt's a guiding principle for the country we've always been and the future we're going to build.\n\nA country where the economy works for everyone, not just those at the top. Where you can get a good job and send your kids to a good school, no matter what zip code you live in.\n\nA country where all our children can dream, and those dreams are within reach. Where families are strong, communities are safe, and yes, where love trumps hate.\n\nThat's the country we're fighting for. That's the future we're working toward. And so, my friends, it is with humility, determination and boundless confidence in America's promise that I accept your nomination for president of the United States!\n\nNow, sometimes, sometimes the people at this podium are new to the national stage.\n\nAs you know, I'm not one of those people.\n\nI've been your First Lady, served eight years as a senator from the great state of New York.\n\nThen I represented all of you as secretary of state.\n\nBut my job titles only tell you what I've done.\n\nThey don't tell you why.\n\nThe truth is, through all these years of public service, the \"service\" part has always come easier to me than the \"public\" part.\n\nI get it that some people just don't know what to make of me. So let me tell you.\n\nThe family I'm from, well, no one had their name on big buildings. My family were builders of a different kind. Builders in the way most American families are.\n\nThey used whatever tools they had \u2014 whatever God gave them \u2014 and whatever life in America provided \u2014 and built better lives and better futures for their kids.\n\nMy grandfather worked in the same Scranton lace mill for 50 years. Because he believed that if he gave everything he had, his children would have a better life than he did. And he was right.\n\nMy dad, Hugh, made it to college. He played football at Penn State and enlisted in the Navy after Pearl Harbor.\n\nWhen the war was over, he started his own small business, printing fabric for draperies. I remember watching him stand for hours over silk screens.\n\nHe wanted to give my brothers and me opportunities he never had. And he did.\n\nMy mother, Dorothy, was abandoned by her parents as a young girl. She\n\nended up on her own at 14, working as a housemaid. She was saved by the kindness of others.\n\nHer first-grade teacher saw she had nothing to eat at lunch and brought extra food to share the entire year. The lesson she passed on to me, years later, stuck with me: No one gets through life alone. We have to look out for each other and lift each other up.\n\nAnd she made sure I learned the words from our Methodist faith: \"Do all the good you can, for all the people you can, in all the ways you can, as long as ever you can.\"\n\nSo, I went to work for the Children's Defense Fund, going door-to-door in New Bedford, Mass., on behalf of children with disabilities who were denied the chance to go to school.\n\nI remember meeting a young girl in a wheelchair on the small back porch of her house. She told me how badly she wanted to go to school \u2014 it just didn't seem possible in those days. And I couldn't stop thinking of my mother and what she'd gone through as a child.\n\nIt became clear to me that simply caring is not enough. To drive real progress, you have to change both hearts and laws. You need both understanding and action.\n\nSo we gathered facts. We built a coalition. And our work helped convince Congress to ensure access to education for all students with disabilities.\n\nIt's a big idea, isn't it? Every kid with a disability has the right to go to school.\n\nBut how, how do you make an idea like that real? You do it step-by-step, year-by-year, sometimes even door-by-door.\n\nMy heart just swelled when I saw Anastasia Somoza representing millions of young people on this stage \u2014 because we changed our law to make sure she got an education.\n\nSo it's true. I sweat the details of policy \u2014 whether we're talking about the exact level of lead in the drinking water in Flint, Mich., the number of mental health facilities in Iowa, or the cost of your prescription drugs.\n\nBecause it's not just a detail if it's your kid \u2014 if it's your family. It's a big deal. And it should be a big deal to your president, too.\n\nAfter the four days of this convention, you've seen some of the people who've inspired me. People who let me into their lives, and became a part of mine.\n\nPeople like Ryan Moore and Lauren Manning. They told their stories Tuesday night.\n\nI first met Ryan as a 7-year-old. He was wearing a full body brace that must have weighed 40 pounds, because I leaned over to lift him up.\n\nChildren like Ryan kept me going when our plan for universal health care failed and kept me working with leaders of both parties to help create the Children's Health Insurance Program that covers 8 million kids in our country.\n\nLauren Manning, who stood here with such grace and power, was gravely injured on 9/11. It was the thought of her, and Debbie St. John who you saw in the movie, and John Dolan and Joe Sweeney, and all the victims and survivors, that kept me working as hard as I could in the Senate on behalf of 9/11 families, and our first responders who got sick from their time at Ground Zero.\n\nI was thinking of Lauren, Debbie and all the others 10 years later in the White House Situation Room when President Obama made the courageous decision that finally brought Osama bin Laden to justice.\n\nAnd in this campaign, I've met many more people who motivate me to keep fighting for change. And, with your help, I will carry all of your voices and stories with me to the White House.\n\nAnd you heard, you heard from, from Republicans and Independents who are supporting our campaign. Well, I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans and independents, for the struggling, the striving, the successful, for all those who vote for me and for those who don't. For all Americans together.\n\nTonight, tonight we've reached a milestone in our nation's march toward a more perfect union: the first time that a major party has nominated a woman for president.\n\nStanding here, standing here as my mother's daughter, and my daughter's mother, I'm so happy this day has come.\n\nI'm happy for grandmothers and little girls and everyone in between.\n\nI'm happy for boys and men, too \u2014 because when any barrier falls in America, it clears the way for everyone. After all, when there are no ceilings, the sky's the limit.\n\nSo let's keep going, let's keep going until every one of the 161 million women and girls across America has the opportunity she deserves to have.\n\nBut even more important than the history we make tonight, is the history we will write together in the years ahead.\n\nLet's begin with what we're going to do to help working people in our country get ahead and stay ahead.\n\nNow, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes.\n\nOur economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs. Twenty million more Americans with health insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever.\n\nNow that's real progress, but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot.\n\nWe're still facing deep-seated problems that developed long before the recession and have stayed with us through the recovery.\n\nI've gone around our country talking to working families. And I've heard from many who feel like the economy sure isn't working for them.\n\nSome of you are frustrated \u2014 even furious. And you know what? You're right. It's not yet working the way it should.\n\nAmericans are willing to work \u2014 and work hard. But right now, an awful lot of people feel there is less and less respect for the work they do. And less respect for them, period.\n\nDemocrats, we are the party of working people. But we haven't done a good enough job showing we get what you're going through, and we're going to do something to help.\n\nSo tonight I want to tell you tonight how we will empower Americans to live better lives.\n\nMy primary mission as president will be to create more opportunity and more good jobs with rising wages right here in the United States. From my first day in office to my last, especially in places that for too long have been left out and left behind.\n\nFrom our inner cities to our small towns, from Indian Country to Coal Country. From communities ravaged by addiction to regions hollowed out by plant closures.\n\nAnd here's what I believe. I believe America thrives when the middle class thrives. I believe that our economy isn't working the way it should because our democracy isn't working the way it should.\n\nThat's why we need to appoint Supreme Court justices who will get money out of politics and expand voting rights, not restrict them.\n\nAnd if necessary, we will pass a constitutional amendment to overturn Citizens United.\n\nI believe American corporations that have gotten so much from our country should be just as patriotic in return. Many of them are. But too many aren't. It's wrong to take tax breaks with one hand and give out pink slips with the other.\n\nAnd I believe Wall Street can never, ever be allowed to wreck Main Street again.\n\nAnd I believe in science. I believe climate change is real and that we can save our planet while creating millions of good-paying clean energy jobs.\n\nI believe that when we have millions of hardworking immigrants contributing to our economy, it would be self-defeating and inhumane to try to kick them out.\n\nComprehensive immigration reform will grow our economy and keep families together \u2014 and it's the right thing to do.\n\nSo, whatever party you belong to, or if you belong to no party at all, if you share these beliefs, this is your campaign.\n\nIf you believe that companies should share profits with their workers, not pad executive bonuses, join us.\n\nIf you believe the minimum wage should be a living wage, and no one working full time should have to raise their children in poverty, join us.\n\nIf you believe that every man, woman and child in America has the right to affordable health care, join us.\n\nIf you believe that we should say \"no\" to unfair trade deals, that we should stand up to China, that we should support our steelworkers and autoworkers and homegrown manufacturers, then join us.\n\nIf you believe we should expand Social Security and protect a woman's right to make her own health care decisions, then join us.\n\nAnd yes, yes, if you believe that your working mother, wife, sister or daughter deserves equal pay, join us.\n\nThat's how we're going to sure this economy works for everyone, not just those at the top.\n\nNow, you didn't hear any of this, did you, from Donald Trump at his convention. He spoke for 70-odd minutes \u2014 and I do mean odd.\n\nAnd he offered zero solutions.\n\nBut we already know he doesn't believe these things. No wonder he doesn't like talking about his plans. You might have noticed, I love talking about mine.\n\nIn my first hundred days, we will work with both parties to pass the biggest investment in new, good-paying jobs since World War II. Jobs in manufacturing, clean energy, technology and innovation, small business, and infrastructure.\n\nIf we invest in infrastructure now, we'll not only create jobs today, but lay the foundation for the jobs of the future.\n\nAnd we will also transform the way we prepare our young people for those jobs.\n\nBernie Sanders and I will work together to make college tuition-free for the middle class and debt-free for all!\n\nWe will also, we will also liberate millions of people who already have student debt.\n\nIt's just not right that Donald Trump can ignore his debts, and students and families can't refinance their debts.\n\nAnd something we don't say often enough: Sure, college is crucial, but a four-year degree should not be the only path to a good job.\n\nWe will help more people learn a skill or practice a trade and make a good living doing it.\n\nWe will give small businesses like my dad's a boost. Make it easier to get credit. Way too many dreams die in the parking lots of banks.\n\nIn America, if you can dream it, you should be able to build it.\n\nAnd we will help you balance family and work. And you know what, if fighting for affordable child care and paid family leave is playing the \"woman card,\" then deal me in.\n\nNow, here's the other thing, we're not only going to make all these investments, we're going to pay for every single one of them.\n\nAnd here's how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes.\n\nThis is not because we resent success, because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is, and we are going to follow the money.\n\nAnd if companies take tax breaks and then ship jobs overseas, we'll make them pay us back. And we'll put that money to work where it belongs, creating jobs here at home!\n\nNow, now I imagine some of you are sitting at home thinking, well, that all sounds pretty good. But how are you going to get it done? How are you going to break through the gridlock in Washington?\n\nWell, look at my record. I've worked across the aisle to pass laws and treaties and to launch new programs that help millions of people. And if you give me the chance, that's what I'll do as president.\n\nBut then I also imagine people are thinking out there, but Trump, he's a businessman. He must know something about the economy.\n\nWell, let's take a closer look.\n\nIn Atlantic City, 60 miles from here, you will find contractors and small businesses who lost everything because Donald Trump refused to pay his bills.\n\nNow, remember what the president said last night: \"Don't boo, vote.\" People who did the work and needed the money, and didn't get it \u2014 not because he couldn't pay them, but because he wouldn't pay them. He just stiffed them.\n\nAnd you know that sales pitch he's making to be president? Put your faith in him \u2014 and you'll win big? That's the same sales pitch he made to all those small businesses. Then Trump walked away, and left working people holding the bag.\n\nHe also talks a big game about putting America first. Well, please explain what part of \"America First\" leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.\n\nDonald Trump says he wants to make America great again \u2014 well, he could start by actually making things in America again.\n\nNow, the choice we face in this election is just as stark when it comes to our national security.\n\nYou know, anyone, anyone reading the news can see the threats and turbulence we face.\n\nFrom Baghdad to Kabul, to Nice and Paris and Brussels, from San Bernardino to Orlando, we're dealing with determined enemies that must be defeated.\n\nSo, it's no wonder that people are anxious and looking for reassurance. Looking for steady leadership, wanting a leader who understands we are stronger when we work with our allies around the world and care for our veterans here at home. Keeping our nation safe and honoring the people who do that work will be my highest priority.\n\nI'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot \u2014 now we have to enforce it. And we must keep supporting Israel's security.\n\nI'm proud that we shaped a global climate agreement \u2014 now we have to hold every country accountable to their commitments, including ourselves.\n\nAnd I'm proud to stand by our allies in NATO against any threat they face, including from Russia.\n\nI've laid out my strategy for defeating ISIS. We will strike their sanctuaries from the air, and support local forces taking them out on the ground. We will surge our intelligence so that we detect and prevent attacks before they happen.\n\nWe will disrupt their efforts online to reach and radicalize young people in our country.\n\nIt won't be easy or quick, but make no mistake \u2014 we will prevail.\n\nNow Donald Trump, Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, \"I know more about ISIS than the generals do.\" No, Donald, you don't.\n\nHe thinks, he thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are \"a disaster.\"\n\nWell, I've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee, and I know how wrong he is. Our military is a national treasure.\n\nWe entrust our commander in chief to make the hardest decisions our nation faces, decisions about war and peace, life and death.\n\nA president should respect the men and women who risk their lives to serve our country \u2014 including Captain Khan and the sons of Tim Kaine and Mike Pence, both Marines.\n\nSo just ask yourself: Do you really think Donald Trump has the temperament to be commander in chief?\n\nDonald Trump can't even handle the rough-and-tumble of a presidential campaign. He loses his cool at the slightest provocation. When he's gotten a tough question from a reporter. When he's challenged in a debate. When he sees a protester at a rally.\n\nImagine, if you dare, imagine, imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis. A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.\n\nI can't put it, I can't put it any better than Jackie Kennedy did after the Cuban Missile Crisis. She said that what worried President Kennedy during that very dangerous time was that a war might be started, not by big men with self-control and restraint, but by little men \u2014 the ones moved by fear and pride.\n\nAmerica's strength doesn't come from lashing out. It relies on smarts, judgment, cool resolve, and the precise and strategic application of power. And that's the kind of commander in chief I pledge to be.\n\nAnd if we're serious about keeping our country safe, we also can't afford to have a president who's in the pocket of the gun lobby.\n\nI'm not here to repeal the Second Amendment. I'm not here to take away your guns. I just don't want you to be shot by someone who shouldn't have a gun in the first place.\n\nWe will work tirelessly with responsible gun owners to pass common-sense reforms and keep guns out of the hands of criminals, terrorists and all others who would do us harm.\n\nYou know, for decades, people have said this issue was too hard to solve and the politics too hot to touch. But I ask you: How can we just stand by and do nothing?\n\nYou heard, you saw, family members of people killed by gun violence on this stage.\n\nYou heard, you saw, family members of police officers killed in the line of duty because they were outgunned by criminals.\n\nI refuse to believe we can't find common ground here.\n\nWe have to heal the divides in our country. Not just on guns. But on race. Immigration. And more.\n\nAnd that starts with listening, listening to each other. Trying, as best we can, to walk in each other's shoes.\n\nSo let's put ourselves in the shoes of young black and Latino men and women who face the effects of systemic racism, and are made to feel like their lives are disposable.\n\nLet's put ourselves in the shoes of police officers, kissing their kids and spouses goodbye every day, heading off to do a dangerous and necessary job.\n\nWe will reform our criminal justice system from end to end and rebuild trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.\n\nAnd we will defend, we will defend all our rights \u2014 civil rights, human rights and voting rights, women's rights and workers' rights, LGBT rights and the rights of people with disabilities!\n\nAnd we will stand up against mean and divisive rhetoric wherever it comes from.\n\nYou know, for the past year, many people made the mistake of laughing off Donald Trump's comments \u2014 excusing him as an entertainer just putting on a show.\n\nThey thought he couldn't possibly mean all the horrible things he says \u2014 like when he called women \"pigs.\" Or said that an American judge couldn't be fair because of his Mexican heritage.\n\nOr when he mocks and mimics a reporter with a disability. Or insults prisoners of war like John McCain \u2014 a true hero and patriot who deserves our respect.\n\nNow, at first, at first, I admit, I couldn't believe he meant it either. It was just too hard to fathom \u2014 that someone who wants to lead our nation could say those things. Could be like that.\n\nBut here's the sad truth: There is no other Donald Trump. This is it.\n\nAnd in the end, it comes down to what Donald Trump doesn't get: that America is great \u2014 because America is good.\n\nSo enough with the bigotry and bombast. Donald Trump's not offering real change.\n\nHe's offering empty promises. And what are we offering? A bold agenda to improve the lives of people across our country \u2014 to keep you safe, to get you good jobs, and to give your kids the opportunities they deserve.\n\nThe choice is clear, my friends.\n\nEvery generation of Americans has come together to make our country freer, fairer and stronger.\n\nNone of us ever have or can do it alone.\n\nI know that at a time when so much seems to be pulling us apart, it can be hard to imagine how we'll ever pull together.\n\nBut I'm here to tell you tonight \u2014 progress is possible.\n\nI know, I know because I've seen it in the lives of people across America who get knocked down and get right back up.\n\nAnd I know it, I know it from my own life. More than a few times, I've had to pick myself up and get back in the game.\n\nLike so much else in my life, I got this from my mother too. She never let me back down from any challenge. When I tried to hide from a neighborhood bully, she literally blocked the door. \"Go back out there,\" she said.\n\nAnd she was right. You have to stand up to bullies.\n\nYou have to keep working to make things better, even when the odds are long and the opposition is fierce.\n\nWe lost our mother a few years ago, but I miss her every day. And I still hear her voice urging me to keep working, keep fighting for right, no matter what.\n\nThat's what we need to do together as a nation.\n\nThough \"we may not live to see the glory,\" as the song from the musical Hamilton goes, \"let us gladly join the fight.\"\n\nLet our legacy be about \"planting seeds in a garden you never get to see.\"\n\nThat's why we're here ... not just in this hall, but on this Earth.\n\nThe Founders showed us that. And so have many others since.\n\nThey were drawn together by love of country, and the selfless passion to build something better for all who follow.\n\nThat is the story of America. And we begin a new chapter tonight.\n\nYes, the world is watching what we do.\n\nYes, America's destiny is ours to choose.\n\nSo let's be stronger together, my fellow Americans.\n\nLet's look to the future with courage and confidence.\n\nLet's build a better tomorrow for our beloved children and our beloved country.\n\nAnd when we do, America will be greater than ever.\n\nThank you, and may God bless you and the United States of America!", "179": "BUSTED: Clinton Foundation Directly Tied To Plot To Steal Election Posted on October 27, 2016 by Prissy Holly in Politics Share This \nEver since early voting began, numerous reports are claiming that the electronic voting machines are rigged, as votes for Donald Trump are automatically switched to Hillary Clinton. We\u2019ve all begun to suspect that Hillary is behind the scam, and now, we have further proof that Democrats are the ones tampering with these machines as part of their intricate plan to steal the election. \nWe recently reported how Hillary\u2019s evil billionaire funder George Soros owns the voting machines in 16 key states, which immediately set off warning bells nationwide. Disturbingly, the massive fraud taking place is not just confined to those 16 areas, as another crooked player in Hillary\u2019s election-stealing plot has just been revealed. \nIn a bombshell just unearthed by independent researcher Micro Spooky Leaks , A Canadian company by the name of Dominion Voting provides the voting machines to 600 jurisdictions in 22 states and is directly linked to the Clinton Foundation as one of their massive donors. \nOn their homepage, the company alludes to how they help rig elections, stating \u201c we strive to change elections for the better!\u201d which is a chilling statement considering they supply 50% of the electronic voting machines on the U.S. voting market. \nRight after this startling information was revealed, however, it appears as though Democrats immediately began white-washing the information, as the link to the statement on the Wikipedia page that corroborated the bombshell information was mysteriously removed. \nHillary has played dirty for years, and it appears as though her antics aren\u2019t stopping now. After murdering many people close to exposing her scandals as a way to prevent them from ruining her presidential bid, the only thing left now is to steal the election through massive voter fraud. \nThe picture at this point is becoming bleak. There\u2019s no doubt that Donald Trump can defeat Hillary, as evidenced by his early lead in many historically blue states, and the recent bombshell that Hillary\u2019s lead across many polls is completely fake. \nHowever, fighting back against electronic voting machines that have been calibrated by Hillary operatives to switch votes from Republican to Democrat will be extremely difficult. The only thing we can do at this point is demand a paper ballot when we vote. Dominion Voting machines that will be used in 22 states \nWe are coming down to the wire here. Every day, more information surfaces on Hillary and the Democrats\u2019 crooked scheme to steal the election. Continue to share stories like this and help fight back and spread the information. \nKnowledge is power, and with the ability to instantly share information with the internet, we can help expose what\u2019s going on by constantly barraging our clueless friends and family members with the truth.", "180": "WASHINGTON -- Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy (D) will sign an executive order on Monday barring state-funded travel to Indiana because of the state's new law that could allow businesses to turn away gay and lesbian customers for religious reasons.\n\nMalloy's move would make Connecticut the first state to boycott Indiana over its Religious Freedom Restoration Act, which Gov. Mike Pence (R) quietly signed into law last week. The law allows businesses in the state to cite religious beliefs as a legal defense. Opponents fear it offers legal protection for businesses to refuse service to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people.\n\nTwo cities, San Francisco and Seattle, have imposed similar bans in response to the law. Businesses have also retaliated. Angie's List is pulling a campus expansion project in Indianapolis, and the CEO of Salesforce, a $4 billion software corporation, announced plans to \"dramatically reduce our investment\" in the state because of the law.\n\nTwenty states have RFRA laws, but Indiana's law is substantially different. While other state RFRAs apply to disputes between a person and a government, Indiana's law goes further and applies to disputes between private citizens. That means, for example, a business owner could use the law to justify discrimination against customers who might otherwise be protected under law.\n\nThe Indiana law could result in \"employers, landlords, small business owners, or corporations, taking the law into their own hands and acting in ways that violate generally applicable laws on the grounds that they have a religious justification for doing so,\" reads their letter. \"Members of the public will then be asked to bear the cost of their employer's, their landlord's, their local shopkeeper's, or a police officer's private religious beliefs.\"\n\nThat's in sharp contrast to states like Connecticut, which has an RFRA but one that pertains only to religious institutions, not private establishments. And unlike some other states, Connecticut also doesn't permit discrimination based on sexual orientation in any private establishment or institution.\n\nBefore signing the order, he called the Indiana law \"disturbing and outright discriminatory,\" and said the National Collegiate Athletic Association should relocate its Final Four tournament from Indiana to another state. Those games are set to begin later this week.\n\n\"I think that would be a wise choice for them to do if that's possible,\" said Malloy. \"I'll leave it up to them to make those decisions.\"\n\nThe NCAA president Mark Emmert has said he is \"surprised and disappointed\" by Indiana's law, and that he is waiting for some kind of clarification to the law, or an outright repeal, before deciding whether to keep holding sporting events in the state.\n\nMalloy said his executive order allows for any of the state's current contractual obligations with Indiana to play out, but said he doesn't plan to enter into any new ones.\n\n\"Somebody's got to stand up to this kind of bigotry and I'm prepared to do it,\" he said.", "181": "Wisconsin Gov.\u00a0Scott Walker\u00a0confronted doubts about his foreign-policy acumen during remarks Saturday to a largely sympathetic audience.\n\nAt the end of a 45-minute discussion with wealthy conservatives, the moderator referred to complaints that Mr. Walker was \u201cnot prepared to speak about foreign policy\u201d at a recent donor meeting in New York, and asked him what he was doing to bone up on the topic.", "182": "Iran successfully test-fired a medium-range ballistic missile capable of striking U.S. forces in the region as well as Israel, the third such test since the nuclear agreement with Western nations took effect in January, multiple defense officials confirmed to Fox News.\n\nThe rogue nation conducted the test in defiance of a United Nations resolution that calls on Iran to cease work on its ballistic missile program.\n\n\u201cIran has to abide by U.N.\u00a0resolutions with regard to ballistic missiles tests, and if they have violated\u00a0or not been consistent with those resolutions, that clearly would be a concern\u00a0for us,\u201d Pentagon Press Secretary Peter Cook said.\n\nAny ballistic missile launch by Iran is tracked by U.S. military spy satellites which pick up the flash during launch. This case was no different, according to officials.\n\nGen. Ali Abdollahi, deputy chief of the armed forces' headquarters,\u00a0said the latest missile tested is very accurate, within 8 meters. \"Eight meters means nothing, it means it's without any error,\" he said. He did not elaborate.\n\nIn March, Iran test-fired two ballistic missiles -- one emblazoned with the phrase \"Israel must be wiped out\" in Hebrew -- that set off an international outcry.\n\nSince December, Iran has shipped out its low-enriched uranium, disabled its heavy water reactor in Arak, and weeks ago sold more than $8 million worth of heavy water to the U.S. in compliance with the nuclear deal. However, Iran has ignored separate U.N. resolutions barring the Islamic republic from ballistic missile tests. Fox News was first to report a secret Iranian ballistic missile launch in November.\n\nThe test-firing was carried out two weeks ago, Iran's semi-official Tasnim news agency quoted Abdollahi as saying. Tasnim is close to the country's powerful Revolutionary Guard, which is in charge of Iranian ballistic missiles program.\n\nThe agency said the missile has a range of 1,250 miles -- enough to reach much of the Middle East. Iranian military commanders have described them as a strategic asset and a strong deterrent, capable of hitting U.S. bases or Israel in the event of a strike on Iran.\n\nAnalysts say Iran is likely seeking to demonstrate it is making progress with its ballistic program, despite scaling back on the nuclear program following the deal that led to the lifting of international sanction on Tehran.\n\nLast month, Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, chief of the Guard's airspace division, said a new, upgraded version of the Sajjil -- a solid fuel high-speed missile with a range of 1,200 miles that was first tested in 2008 -- would soon be ready.\n\nBut it was not immediately clear if the missile Abdollahi referred to was the new Sajjil.\n\nThe landmark deal does not include provisions against missile launches and when it came into effect on Jan. 16, the Security Council lifted most U.N. sanctions against Tehran, including a ban it had imposed in 2010 on Iran testing missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads.\n\nTo deal with the restrictions in the nuclear agreement, the council adopted a resolution last July, which only \"calls on\" Iran not to carry out such tests.\n\nFox News' Lucas Tomlinson and The Associated Press contributed to this report.", "183": "\nIn an excerpt of a John Pilger Special interview, Julian Assange says that emails released by Wikileaks show that Hillary Clinton is intentionally misguiding voters about the degree to which US allies are supporting ISIS, and that Donald Trump will not be allowed into the oval office.\nAssange explains that the same financial interests funding ISIS are funding Clinton. He references a 2014 email from John Podesta to Clinton, in which we find the following:\nWhile this military/para-military operation is moving forward, we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia, which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.\n\n\u201cI think this is the most significant email in the whole collection,\u201d said Assange. \u201cAll serious analysts know, and even the US government has agreed, that some Saudi figures have been supporting ISIS and funding ISIS, but the dodge has always been that it is some \u2018rogue\u2019 princes using their oil money to do whatever they like, but actually the government disapproves. But that email says that it is the government of Saudi Arabia, and the government of Qatar that have been funding ISIS.\u201d\nPilger asked Assange about the possibility that Trump would steal the election with the help of Russia, as many in the Democratic party claim.\nAssange thinks that this is highly unlikely, but not because he is unpopular. \u201cMy analysis is that Trump would not be permitted to win. Why do I say that? Because he has had every establishment off his side. Trump does not have one establishment, maybe with the exception of the Evangelicals, if you can call them establishment,\u201d he explained.\nAssange says that Hillary is the establishment pick. \u201cBanks, intelligence, arms companies, foreign money, etc. are all united behind Hillary Clinton.

Yeah, he's sloppy and meandering and says some nutty stuff. But that's all part of being genuine and three-dimensional, which may be the most valuable trait in modern politics and not a bad contrast to Clinton's robotic discipline.\"\n\nAnd Biden's certainly got the resume. When President Barack Obama wanted to make sure stimulus money didn't disappear to fraud, he turned to Biden \u2014 \"nobody messes with Joe,\" he said \u2014 and Biden\u00a0succeeded. When the White House wanted to avoid the fiscal cliff, it was Biden who\u00a0closed the deal with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. When Obama flubbed the first debate against Mitt Romney, it was Biden who restored the ticket's mojo by bullying his way past Rep. Paul Ryan. When the Democrats held their 2012 convention, it was Biden's speech that pulled\u00a0the highest ratings \u2014 beating both Bill Clinton and Obama.\n\nBiden's most off-the-reservation moment, meanwhile, is the kind of thing that should help him in 2016. He pushed the Obama administration to embrace gay marriage before it was quite ready. At the time, it looked like a gaffe. Now it looks prescient.\n\nAnd yet,\u00a0according to a recent Marist poll, Biden is running 47 points behind Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination in 2016 \u2014 and only one point ahead of Sen. Elizabeth Warren. A quick scan of RealClearPolitics' round-up of Democratic primary polls shows that's no outlier.\n\nIt's not like Biden has been out of the public eye for the last seven years. So why, if he's such a good politician, doesn't he command more support in the Democratic Party?\n\nHere's my guess:\u00a0there's a cultural gap between Biden and the party he seeks to represent. Biden is an old-school, white, male politician in a party that's increasingly young, multicultural, and female. Biden's gaffes matter because they tend to reinforce the perception among Democrats that he belongs to a different era.\n\nWhen Biden calls shady lenders \"Shylocks,\" or says Obama is \"the first mainstream African-American who is articulate and bright and clean and a nice-looking guy,\" he ends up coming off as, in New York Magazine words, \"your accidentally racist grandma.\" That leaves Biden facing something more toxic than opposition: condescension.\n\nWhat I wrote of Biden in\u00a0January 2013 is still true today, I think. \"In the continuing drama that is the Obama presidency, Biden often appears as comic relief. He's the zany neighbor, the adorable uncle. As a result, his presidential ambitions, which burn brightly even today, have mostly been laughed off. Somehow, the sitting vice president of the United States, the former chairman of both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee, a man who's on a nickname basis with many of the world's most powerful leaders, is seen in many quarters as lacking the gravitas to be president.\"\n\nThere is much that's weird about this. Hillary Clinton is a powerful candidate, but there's nothing about the last few months that makes her look invulnerable. She's shown real rust in interviews, pissed off liberals, and found herself in an email scandal.\n\nBut while Biden isn't much older than Clinton, she's somehow been more adept at signaling cultural affinity with young Democrats than he's been (though she's occasionally struggled too, most notably in\u00a0her interview with Terry Gross on gay marriage). She also has a connection to female voters he can't touch. Even her\u00a0memes are better.\n\nI don't know exactly how Biden fixes this or even if he can. Clinton isn't inevitable, and Biden should, by all rights, pose a real threat to her. But, though Biden's always been known as a great speaker, he needs to learn to talk to a different party than the one he grew up in.", "185": "The Washington game now requires that any unindicted politician with a bit of ambition \u2014 even 75-year-old Jerry Brown \u2014 let it be known that he is thinking about maybe, just possibly running for president.\n\nBut here\u2019s the flip side: the media culture now demands to know whether these pols are quietly plotting a White House bid \u2014 and treats it as sort of strange if the answer is no.\n\nWhat do you mean you\u2019re not feverishly plotting a presidential bid three years before the next election? Is there something wrong with you?\n\nI guess we don\u2019t like to take no for an answer.\n\nTake Paul Ryan. A natural leader of the conservative movement. The Republican VP nominee last year. A man who can translate Beltway jargon into Main Street concerns.\n\nThe Wisconsin congressman is in the spotlight because he just hammered out a budget agreement with Patty Murray that passed the Senate yesterday with 64 votes\u2014three fewer than supported a cloture vote\u2014after winning bipartisan approval in the House. The modest deal is noteworthy mainly because it temporarily ends the Washington gridlock and threats of shutdown and default. But it also brought sniping from more militant conservatives who see Ryan as selling out to the Democrats.\n\nThe dustup triggered a spate of Whither Paul Ryan pieces in the press. \u00a0Is he running?

It\u2019s 2013 already \u2014 we have to know!\n\n\u201cIn interviews The Hill conducted with more than two dozen House Republicans from across the ideological spectrum over the last couple of weeks, many of Ryan\u2019s colleagues said they are doubtful he will run for president in 2016. Most believe that concerns for his young family will lead him to lay claim to the job he\u2019s always wanted: chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.\u201d\n\nRyan wants to be a Hill poohbah and not move into the White House.\n\n\u201cRyan on Tuesday told The Wall Street Journal that he plans to lead the Ways and Means Committee in the next Congress.\u00a0Ryan and his wife Janna have three children, and his friends say that his concern about the hardship of an 18-month presidential campaign is a genuine factor in his consideration.\u201d\n\nThis is the human factor that journalists rarely pause to consider. Running for president is a meat grinder that chews people up, and Ryan got a taste of that as Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether Ryan\u00a0 is being coy, or whether, with the highest positive rating among Iowa Republicans, he\u2019ll change his mind and jump into the race.

Didn\u2019t that set off any alarm bells?\n\nBut the quote caused a stir now that the former Bill Clinton chief of staff is joining the White House, and he tweeted an apology: \u201cIn an old interview, my snark got in front of my judgment.

It was historic! And it netted him four more delegates than Clinton in the state. Meanwhile, in Mississippi, Clinton won with more than 80\u00a0percent of the vote \u2014 and gained 28\u00a0more delegates than Sanders.\n\nOn the best night of the Sanders campaign to date, he fell 24 more delegates behind Clinton in the race for the Democratic nomination.\n\nThat increasingly challenging math is what Sanders must confront Tuesday as voters in several large states \u2014 including Florida, Illinois and Ohio \u2014 go to the polls.\n\n[Clinton leads Sanders by more than 2 to 1 in Florida, Post-Univision poll finds]\n\nAs of today, Clinton has 1,231 delegates to Sanders\u2019s 576 \u2014 a lead of 655. That means that Clinton has 51.7 percent of the 2,383 delegates she needs to become the Democratic Party\u2019s nominee.\n\nSubtract superdelegates \u2014 Clinton is dominating even among this group of elected officials and party luminaries \u2014 and she has 766 delegates to Sanders\u2019s 551, a margin of 215. (Worth noting: That is a wider lead than the margin by which Clinton ever trailed then-Sen. Barack Obama in the long slog of the 2008 primary race.)\n\nThat lead may not seem momentous. After all, almost 3,000 delegates are yet to be allocated in the primaries and caucuses to come. The problem for Sanders is that Democrats allocate their delegates proportionally in every state \u2014 meaning that between now and when the process ends June\u00a07, there is no state where Clinton will be shut out.\n\nWinning, then, is not enough for Sanders. He has to win by a\u00a0lot to make up any real ground.\n\nClinton has already done that. Take, for example, Alabama. She won there March 1 by 59\u00a0points and gained 38 more delegates than Sanders. Or Georgia on that\u00a0same day, beating Sanders by 43\u00a0points and netting 55 delegates. Or the aforementioned Mississippi, where Clinton\u2019s 66-point win translated to a net gain of 28 delegates.\n\n[Southern states help Clinton extend her lead over Sanders]\n\nSanders\u2019s one big win came in New Hampshire\u2019s primary. But his 22-point margin translated to a net delegate gain of zero because six superdelegates pledged to Clinton, bringing her delegate gain up to match his. Similarly, in the Colorado caucuses, Sanders won by 19\u00a0points but the superdelegate math meant the candidates each took 38 delegates.\n\nLook at the next set of big contests, to be held Tuesday. Four states have more than 100 delegates to give out: Florida (246), Illinois (182), Ohio (160) and North Carolina (121).\n\nPolling released Sunday morning suggests that Sanders has a big hill to climb. Clinton leads the senator 61\u00a0percent to 34\u00a0percent in Florida and has an edge of 58\u00a0percent to 38\u00a0percent in Ohio, according to NBC- Marist surveys. The race in Illinois, according to NBC-Marist, is closer, with Clinton at 51\u00a0percent and Sanders at 45\u00a0percent.\n\nBut wait, you say. Polling in Michigan had Sanders down 20 points and he won there. So this polling could be wrong, too.\n\nSure. It could. The problem for Sanders is this: Let\u2019s say each of the NBC-Marist surveys is off by 20 points in Clinton\u2019s favor. (Note that this is a thought experiment. I very much doubt a credible pollster such as this one would be off by even close to that amount.) That would mean Sanders loses Florida by single digits, essentially ties Clinton in Ohio and wins Illinois by 15 points. The delegate allocation from that trio of results? It would almost certainly favor Clinton.\n\nSanders is in a position where winning states is not close to enough if he wants to be the party\u2019s nominee. He needs to start winning big states by big margins. As in winning Illinois or Florida by 30 or 40 points.\n\nThat seems very unlikely either Tuesday or beyond. If past votes are any guide, it will be a tough road for Sanders. There have been seven election nights in the race so far; Clinton has netted delegates in six of them, while the two candidates fought to a draw in the seventh (New Hampshire).\n\nNone of this means that Sanders can\u2019t \u2014 and won\u2019t \u2014 keep running. Winning states matters in terms of perception and keeps the wolves from his door. But winning states and emboldening your supporters aren\u2019t the same as taking concrete steps to reduce or eliminate Clinton\u2019s delegate lead.\n\nThat looks to be a near-impossible task for Sanders unless the numbers in the states to come start changing quickly.", "187": "A recent draft of the Trans-Pacific Partnership free-trade deal would give U.S. pharmaceutical firms unprecedented protections against competition from cheaper generic drugs, possibly transcending the patent protections in U.S. law.\n\nPOLITICO has obtained a draft copy of TPP\u2019s intellectual property chapter as it stood on May 11, at the start of the latest negotiating round in Guam. While U.S. trade officials would not confirm the authenticity of the document, they downplayed its importance, emphasizing that the terms of the deal are likely to change significantly as the talks enter their final stages. Those terms are still secret, but the public will get to see them once the twelve TPP nations reach a final agreement and President Obama seeks congressional approval.\n\nStill, the draft chapter will provide ammunition for critics who have warned that TPP\u2019s protections for pharmaceutical companies could dump trillions of dollars of additional health care costs on patients, businesses and governments around the Pacific Rim. The highly technical 90-page document, cluttered with objections from other TPP nations, shows that U.S. negotiators have fought aggressively and, at least until Guam, successfully on behalf of Big Pharma.\n\nThe draft text includes provisions that could make it extremely tough for generics to challenge brand-name pharmaceuticals abroad. Those provisions could also help block copycats from selling cheaper versions of the expensive cutting-edge drugs known as \u201cbiologics\u201d inside the U.S., restricting treatment for American patients while jacking up Medicare and Medicaid costs for American taxpayers.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s very little distance between what Pharma wants and what the U.S. is demanding,\u201d said Rohit Malpini, director of policy for Doctors Without Borders.\n\nThroughout the TPP talks, the Obama administration has pledged to balance the goals of fostering innovation in the drug industry, which means allowing higher profits, and promoting wider access to valuable medicines, which means keeping prices down. U.S. Trade Representative Michael Froman has pointed out that pharmaceutical companies often have to invest hundreds of millions of dollars to get a new drug to market, which they would have little incentive to do without strong protections for the patented product. But Froman has also recognized the value of allowing much cheaper generic drugs to enter the market after those brand-name patents expire. In the U.S., generics now comprise more than five-sixths of all prescription drugs, but only about one-quarter of drug costs.\n\nAdvocates for the global poor, senior citizens, labor unions and consumers as well as the generics industry have accused the administration of abandoning that balance, pushing a pharmaceutical-company agenda at the expense of patients and taxpayers. One critic, hoping to illustrate the point and rally opposition to TPP in Congress, gave POLITICO the draft chapter, which was labeled \u201cThis Document Contains TPP CONFIDENTIAL Information\u201d on every page.\n\nU.S. officials said the key point to remember about trade deals is that no provision is ever final until the entire deal is final\u2014and that major compromises tend to happen at the very end of the negotiations. They expect the real horse-trading to begin now that Obama has signed \u201cfast-track\u201d legislation requiring Congress to pass or reject TPP without amendments.\n\n\u201cThe negotiations on intellectual property are complex and continually evolving,\u201d said Trevor Kincaid, a spokesman for Froman. \u201cOn pharmaceutical products, we are working closely with stakeholders, Congress, and partner countries to develop an approach that aims to make affordable life-saving medicine more widely available while creating incentives for the development of new treatments and cures. Striking this important balance is at the heart of our work.\u201d\n\nThe draft chapter covers software, music and other intellectual property issues as well, but its most controversial language involves the rights of drug companies. The text reveals disputes between the U.S. (often with support from Japan) and its TPP partners over a variety of issues\u2014what patents can cover, when and how long they can be extended, how long pharmaceutical companies can keep their clinical data private, and much more. On every issue, the U.S. sided with drug companies in favor of stricter intellectual property protections.\n\nSome of the most contentious provisions involve \u201cpatent linkage,\u201d which would prevent regulators in TPP nations from approving generic drugs whenever there are any unresolved patent issues. The TPP draft would make this linkage mandatory, which could help drug companies fend off generics just by claiming an infringement. The Obama administration often describes TPP as the most progressive free-trade deal in history, citing its compliance with the tough labor and environment protections enshrined in the so-called \u201cMay 10 Agreement\u201d of 2007, which set a framework for several trade deals at the time. But mandatory linkage seems to be a departure from the May 10 pharmaceutical provisions.\n\nIn an April 15 letter to Froman, Heather Bresch, the CEO of the generic drug company Mylan, warned that mandatory patent linkage would be \u201ca recipe for indefinite evergreening of pharmaceutical monopolies,\u201d leading to the automatic rejection of generic applications. The U.S. already has mandatory linkage, but most other TPP countries do not, and Bresch argued that U.S. law includes a number of safeguards and incentives for generic companies that have not made it into TPP.\n\n\u201cWith all due respect, the USTR has\u2026cherry-picked the single provision designed to block generic entry to the market,\u201d Bresch wrote.\n\nGenerics are thriving in the U.S. despite linkage, saving Americans an estimated $239 billion on drugs in 2013. But the U.S. is the world\u2019s largest market, and advocates fear that generic manufacturers may not take on the risk and expense of litigation in smaller markets if TPP tilts the playing field against them. One generics manufacturer, Hospira, reportedly testified at a TPP forum in Melbourne, Australia, that it would not launch generics outside the U.S. in markets with linkage.\n\nThe opponents are also worried about the treaty\u2019s effect on the U.S. market, because its draft language would extend mandatory patent linkage to biologics, the next big thing in the pharmaceutical world. Biologics can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars a year for patients with illnesses like rheumatoid arthritis, hepatitis B and cancer, and the first knockoffs have not yet reached pharmacies. The critics say that extending linkage to biologics\u2014which can have hundreds of patents\u2014would help insulate them from competition forever.\n\n\u201cIt would be a dramatic departure from U.S. law, and it would put a real crimp in the ability of less expensive drugs to get to market,\u201d said K.J. Hertz, a lobbyist for AARP. \u201cPeople are going to look at this very closely in Congress.\u201d\n\nDrug companies are already pushing for TPP to guarantee them 12 years of exclusivity for their data regarding biologics, although the draft text suggests the other TPP nations have not agreed. Jay Taylor, vice president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said it\u2019s crucial for TPP to protect the intellectual property that emerges from years of expensive research, so that drug companies can continue to develop new medicines for patients around the world.\n\n\u201cThese innovations could be severely hindered if IP protections are scaled back,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cThis is especially important in the area of biologic medicines, which could hold the key to unlocking treatments for diseases that have thwarted researchers for years.\u201d\n\nU.S. officials would not discuss the status of the TPP talks. But they suggested the May 10 Agreement did include a milder form of linkage, although it didn\u2019t prevent regulators from approving generics mired in patent disputes.\u00a0 They also believe a 2009 U.S. law included a form of linkage for biologics, although again, that law's dispute resolution process for patent issues was not as prescriptive as the TPP draft. And they cautioned that any pre-Guam draft would not reflect recent negotiations over \u201ctransition periods\u201d that would delay the stricter patent standards in developing countries like Vietnam.\n\nIn any case, Kincaid said U.S. negotiators are determined to strike a balance between innovation and access in the final product.\n\n\u201cWhile this is our touchstone, the negotiations are still very much in process, and the details of a final outcome cannot yet be forecasted,\u201d he said.\n\nBut Malpani of Doctors Without Borders said U.S. negotiators have basically functioned as drug lobbyists. The TPP countries have 40 percent of global economic output, and the deal is widely seen as establishing new benchmarks for some of the most complex areas of global business. Malpani fears it could set a precedent that crushes the generic drug industry under a mountain of regulation and litigation.\n\n\u201cWe consider this the worst-ever agreement in terms of access to medicine,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would create higher drug prices around the world\u2014and in the U.S., too.\n\n", "188": "  Posted at 11:03   \nMichael Moore was super excited to learn that Republicans were driving traffic to his film , \u201cTrumpland,\u201d by passing around on social media a four-minute clip, even though he claims it was doctored.

Baltimore authorities and representatives for Gray\u2019s family agree that the 25-year-old sustained fatal trauma to his neck and spine at some point while in police custody following his arrest on April 12. Although a full autopsy hasn't yet been released, the family has said that Gray\u2019s spine was nearly severed, and that his doctors had attempted to repair three fractured neck vertebrae and a crushed voice box. Last week, The Baltimore Sun spoke to medical experts who said that Gray's injuries were, in the paper's words, comparable to those seen in \u201cvictims of high-speed crashes.\u201d\n\nWhile this may end up being a significant detail of the investigation, much is still unclear about the circumstances of Gray's death, including how Gray's head might have hit the wall of the van hard enough to kill him. Over the past few weeks, Baltimore police have provided few answers about how Gray went from seemingly healthy enough to flee police on the morning of April 12 to dead on April 19 after a week in a coma. On Wednesday, April 29, hours after stating that they would not give the public their forthcoming internal report on Gray's death, police leaked a different document to The Washington Post. It was the first new piece of information from police in nearly a week. But instead of clarity, it offered more confusion.\n\nIn its reporting of the incident, The Baltimore Sun found witnesses who refuted Miller's account to the court. In an April 25 article, Sun reporter Kevin Rector wrote: \u201cKevin Moore, a 28-year-old friend of Gray's from Gilmor Homes, said he rushed outside when he heard Gray was being arrested and saw him \u2018screaming for his life\u2019 with his face planted on the ground. One officer had his knee on Gray's neck, Moore said, and another was bending his legs backward. \u2018They had him folded up like he was a crab or a piece of origami,\u2019 Moore said. \u2018He was all bent up.\u2019\" Others claimed to have seen officers beating Gray with batons.\n\nAt one point during the arrest, according to the police commissioner, an officer pulled out a stun gun. Moore claimed to have seen this as well. According to the Sun, police investigators failed to obtain footage from a convenience store surveillance camera that may have captured the incident more clearly. Instead, the officers found that the moment in question had been taped over by the time they got there. This was a common theme throughout the investigation, as officers reportedly failed to obtain footage from other cameras that may have recorded key moments in Gray's subsequent ride to the police station.\n\nA third perspective on Gray's arrest was added to the mix on Wednesday, when CNN interviewed an anonymous relative of one of the arresting officers. The woman said the officer believes Gray \"was injured outside the paddy wagon,\" though she expressed personal concern that \"six officers are going to be punished behind something that maybe one or two or even three officers may have done to Freddie Gray.\"\n\nThis is the critical question, and there is still no clear answer. Witness video shows Gray screaming at the time he was loaded into the vehicle. According to the official police timeline, the van made its first stop four minutes later so that officers could shackle an \"irate\" Gray. He was removed from the van and was placed in leg irons.\n\nPolice and witnesses then agree that Gray was returned to the van in both hand and leg restraints. Officers have admitted they didn't buckle Gray's seat belt, a violation of police department policy that has led to suggestions that Gray may have been the victim of a \"rough ride\" -- an illegal but not uncommon technique in which officers drive vans in such a way as to cause injury to detained passengers.\n\nAt 8:59 a.m., about 15 minutes after Gray was first put in the van, the vehicle stopped for a third time after the driver asked an officer to perform a check on Gray. This had previously been explained as the second stop, and exactly what happened there was reportedly a key part of the investigation. Batts has said that responding officers had to \"pick [Gray] up off the floor and place him on the seat,\" and that Gray requested a medic at this time. He was ignored again.\n\nThe fourth and final stop was made minutes later to pick up another prisoner. At this point, it's unclear what state Gray was in. Davis has suggested that Gray was again found on the floor, but responsive enough to make another request for a medic. If this request was indeed made, it was evidently denied. Other reports suggest that Gray may have already lost consciousness when this second person was picked up.\n\nDetails of Allen's account conflict with earlier reports on Gray's time in the van, including reports from police officials themselves. According to the Post, Allen told investigators that Gray was \u201cbanging against the walls\u201d and \"intentionally trying to injure himself.\u201d But Allen later told WBAL: \"When I got in the van, I didn't hear nothing. It was a smooth ride. We went straight to the police station. All I heard was a little banging for about four seconds. I just heard little banging, just little banging.\"", "190": "The female prison employee at the center of an investigation into the escape of two killers pleaded not guilty Friday night to helping them flee the maximum security facility.\n\nPrison tailor shop instructor Joyce Mitchell, 51, was arraigned on a felony charge of promoting prison contraband and misdemeanor count of criminal facilitation, authorities said.\n\nMitchell is accused of aiding in the escape of inmates David Sweat and Richard Matt from the Clinton Correctional Facility in upstate New York last week.\n\nShe entered the court room with her hands cuffed in front of her, clad jeans and a lime green top looking terrified. She did not speak. She was ordered held in jail on $100,000 cash bail or $200,000 bond on felony county and is due back in court Monday morning.\n\nDistrict Attorney Andrew Wylie said earlier Friday the contraband did not include the power tools used by the men as they cut holes in their cell walls and a steam pipe to escape through a manhole last weekend.\n\nWylie didn't elaborate on the charges Friday as more than 800 officers continued to search for the escapees, concentrating in a rural area around the prison in the Adirondacks near the Canadian border. Earlier residents reported seeing \u00a0tow men jumping a stone wall outside Dannemora.\n\nMaj. Charles Guess of the New York State gave a stern warning to the convicts at an evening press conference,\n\n\"We're coming for you and will not stop until you are caught,\" he said.\n\nHe added that Mitchell's arrest represented \"one large piece of the puzzle in our quest\" to find the men.\n\nAsked about any clues to the escapees' whereabouts, Guess said there was no \"conclusive evidence\" that either had left the area. None of the reports of possible sightings has been confirmed, he added.\n\n\"It's day six,\" he said, \"and if they have not escaped the area, you've got to assume they're cold, wet, tired and hungry.\"\n\nAs to whether they split up, Guess said, \"there's no reason to believe they're not together but we're planning for both eventualities.\"\n\nEarlier, Wylie said Mitchell, a supervisor in the prison's tailoring shop, brought \"contraband\" into the prison but he declined to elaborate on what, specifically, she gave the men.\n\nThe Albany Times-Union reported late Thursday that Mitchell told New York State Police she gave Matt, 48, and Sweat, 34, access to a cell phone and smuggled tools into the prison.\n\nA police source close to the investigation confirmed to Fox News Friday that Mitchell planned to provide a getaway car for the two convicted murderers but had a change of heart at the last minute. Mitchell instead checked herself into a hospital some 40 miles away from the prison, complaining of panic attacks, according to law enforcement.\n\nMitchell joined the prison staff in March of 2008 and earned $57,697 a year. She was suspended without pay, effective Friday.\n\nPolice, meanwhile, said Friday that two men believed to be the inmates were spotted jumping over a stone wall in the woods in Saranac, a few miles from the prison, the Buffalo News reported. According to the newspaper, a law enforcement officer said he believes he saw the two at 7:30 a.m. Friday and authorities converged on the area.\n\nColleen Cringle, who lives on Cringle road in Saranac, told the newspaper police were using her home as a staging area to search for the killers.\n\nNew York Gov. Andrew Cuomo has vowed that state law would come down hard on any prison system employee who crosses the line with inmates.\n\n\"If you do it, you will be convicted, and then you'll be on the other side of the prison that you've been policing, and that is not a pleasant place to be,\" Cuomo said. The governor also said investigators are \"talking to several people who may have facilitated the escape.\"\n\nThe Times-Union also reported that Mitchell had been investigated in recent months by the state corrections department's inspector general after a fellow prison worker complained that she had gotten too close to Sweat and Matt. That investigation did not result in any discipline.\n\nPrison employees and correction officers are prohibited from having relationships with inmates or performing favors for them.\n\nMatt was serving 25 years to life for the 1997 kidnap, torture and hacksaw dismemberment of Matt's 76-year-old former boss, whose body was found in pieces in a river.\n\nMatt and an accomplice stuffed William Rickerson in a car trunk in his pajamas and drove around with him for 27 hours because he wouldn't tell them the location of large sums of money he was believed to have.\n\nAccording to testimony, Matt bent back the elderly man's fingers until they broke and later snapped Rickerson's neck with his bare hands.\n\nAfter the killing, Matt fled to Mexico, where he killed a man outside a bar.\n\nSweat was doing life without parole for his part in the 2002 killing of sheriff's Deputy Kevin Tarsia, who was shot 15 times and run over after discovering Sweat and two accomplices transferring stolen guns between vehicles.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nClick for more from The Albany Times-Union", "191": "0 Add Comment \nRATHER than relax and play Texas Hold \u2018Em with his friends as they had a few cans after a recent night out, hardcore culchie Noel Kennelan desperatley attempted to explain the impenetrable rules of the card game \u201925\u2019, which he claims is \u2018way better than poker, hi\u2019. \n25, also known as \u2018that culchie game\u2019, involves the dealing of 5 cards to each player and the reveal of a trump card, followed by at least 10 minutes of explaining how the 2 of spades can beat the 9 of diamonds if spades were lead with, and diamonds aren\u2019t trump. \nKennelan, 28, made great efforts to explain to the 6 other men around the table of his Dublin flat the baffling rules of \u2018stealing\u2019 and \u2018reneging\u2019, but in the end had to concede that the game was too complex and the players were too drunk to fully wrap their heads around it. \n\u201cAfter the nightclub, back to the house, few cans, the cards come out,\u201d said Kennelan, dealing himself a solemn hand of Patience. \n\u201cThe lads all play poker, but 25 is where it\u2019s at.

Legalizing marijuana is on the ballot in Ohio, Houston voters will decide on an equal rights ordinance and San Francisco weighs short-term rentals in what's being called the \"Airbnb Initiative.\"\n\nElsewhere, eyes are on governor races in Kentucky and Louisiana, and whether Democrats can make any progress in the South.\n\nHere's a look at some of the races:\n\nHouston voters will decide whether to keep an equal rights ordinance that was approved by the City Council last year. The Houston Equal Rights Ordinance (HERO) would ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity \u2014 criteria not covered by national anti-discrimination laws. The ordinance is hotly debated, particularly after some opposition ads were released. The ads claim that the ordinance would allow men who identify as women to assault women and young girls in bathrooms.\n\nHillary Clinton tweeted her support for the ordinance on Oct. 29, writing: \"No one should face discrimination for who they are or who they love \u2014 I support efforts for Equality in Houston & beyond. #HERO #YesOnProp1 -H\".\n\nA White House spokesman said that President Obama and Vice President Biden were \"confident that the citizens of Houston will vote in favor of fairness and equality.\"\n\nUpdate from Houston Public Media: Houston's voters strongly rejected the anti-discrimination measure, with about three-fifths of voters opposed.\n\nRepublican Matt Bevin and Democrat Jack Conway are running to replace retiring Gov. Steve Beshear, a Democrat. Although Republicans have aggressively been spending money in the hope of retaining the governor's mansion, Conway has outspent Bevin 4 to 1. This race has been characterized by both candidates accusing each other of lying about their records.\n\nUpdate from WFPL in Louisville: Conway conceded the race \u2014 the returns late Tuesday night showed Bevin winning with about 53 percent of the vote \u2014 and Republicans generally performed well in the state.\n\nLouisiana has a gubernatorial election this year but it doesn't work the way you might expect. Louisiana's election system relies on what's called a \"jungle primary.\" In a jungle primary, all candidates regardless of party appear on one ballot. If no one wins 50 percent of the vote, the top two candidates face each other in a runoff election.\n\nJohn Bel Edwards, a Democrat and state legislative leader, earned roughly 40 percent of the vote. He now will face Sen. David Vitter, a Republican, in the runoff election on Nov. 21. Vitter has had a tough race so far. His critics have continuously cited his involvement in a 2007 prostitution scandal, in which Vitter's telephone number was found in the records of the so-called D.C. Madam, Deborah Palfrey. Palfrey was accused of running a prostitution ring that made more than $2 million over 13 years.\n\nThe \"Clean Elections Initiative\" would increase public funding for candidates to up to $3 million in order to make them more competitive against privately-funded candidates, according to Reuters. The existing law makes up to $2 million available to candidates for state office. The ballot measure would also increase disclosure requirements and increase the penalties for campaign finance violations.\n\nUpdate from the Portland Press Herald: The measure passed, with 55 percent of the vote as of late Tuesday:\n\nRepublican Gov. Phil Bryant is up for reelection and faces opposition from an unlikely candidate \u2014 truck driver and political unknown Robert Gray. According to The Associated Press, Gray didn't even tell his closest relatives that he had signed up to campaign for governor. Bryant has spent roughly $2.7 million this year and reportedly has $1.4 million in the bank. Gray has spent about $3,000 on his campaign in the past three months.\n\nUpdate from Mississippi Public Broadcasting: Gray will presumably be back on the road after losing, 67 percent to 32 percent.\n\nOhio voters vote on two ballot measures with constitutional amendments that could dramatically change marijuana laws in their state. Issue 3, as one of these two measures is called, would enable landowners or operators of 10 predetermined sites the right to grow commercial marijuana. That's in contradiction to the second measure, Issue 2, which would prohibit monopolies from being enshrined in the state constitution. If both measures pass, there's sure to be lots of confusion.\n\nUpdate from WCPN in Cleveland: Voters rejected legal and medical marijuana, with two-thirds voting against Issue 3; Issue 2, the measure rejecting the proposed marijuana oligopoly, was passing 54 percent to 46 percent.\n\nSan Franciscans heading to the polls Tuesday will get to vote on Proposition F, colloquially known as the \"Airbnb Initiative.\" The initiative is a ballot measure that would strengthen regulation on the short-term rental of houses and apartments. While Airbnb is likely the biggest company in that niche market, the Los Angeles Times points out that there are other vacation rental companies that would be affected. Right now, residents can rent out their apartment or home for 90 days in a year. Proposition F would limit that rental period to 75 days. The measure is viewed as an attempt to discourage people from taking units off the housing market and using them as short-term apartment rentals. San Francisco has an acute housing shortage.\n\nUpdate from KQED in San Francisco: Voters rejected the measure, Proposition F, 55 percent to 45 percent.\n\nSeattle voters will decide on a campaign finance measure that's being touted as a national model for campaign finance reform. Ballot initiative I-122, if passed, would create a public financing model in the city. Every resident would receive a $100 voucher to give to the candidate of their choosing. The measure would also limit election campaign contributions from entities receiving city contracts of $250,000 or more, or from people spending more than $5,000 on lobbying.\n\nUpdate from KUOW in Seattle: Voters overwhelmingly passed the measure, 60 percent to 40 percent.\n\nAll 140 seats of Virginia's General Assembly are up for election today. Republicans currently control the state Senate, 21 seats to 19. Expecting low turnout, both parties have been trying to drive their message home to voters. Republicans are expected to retain their majority in the GA. Democrats hope to take control of the state Senate.\n\nUpdate from the Richmond Times-Dispatch: Republicans have kept their majority in the Senate, and their strong control of the General Assembly.", "193": "It\u2019s impossible to overstate how colossal a fuckup this is. At every level, across both parties, the media, pollsters \u2014 all the democratic institutions that are supposed to prevent something like this from happening or at least warn us about it. Donald Trump, a\u00a0Republican candidate who ran an openly racist campaign, who is as proud a misogynist as you\u2019ll find anywhere, who is manifestly ignorant of public policy, who is brusquely authoritarian, who has little respect or understanding of democratic norms and who embodies every moral failing that\u2019s supposed to disqualify a candidate from higher office, has apparently been elected\u00a0as the next president of the United States.\n\nThe markets are collapsing, the globe is reeling, and nobody can quite explain what the hell happened. But here\u2019s what this failure will mean: The climate, which is warming precipitously, is now guaranteed to continue along that trajectory toward global catastrophe. The millions of people who gained health coverage over the last half of a decade are now at acute risk of being thrown off their insurance plan and left to the unfeeling mercies of\u00a0insurance underwriters.\n\nIncome inequality, already at dangerously high levels, will only grow worse as tax cuts for the rich and spending cuts for the poor are pushed through the Republican Congress. Unprecedented GOP obstructionism on Supreme Court nominees has been rewarded in the worst possible way. And the foreign policy of the United States will be run by a bona fide ignoramus.\n\nThe man elected to the most powerful office in the land has no idea what to do with it and no concept of its limitations. He attracts the worst people to him, sycophants and power-hungry strivers who will be placed in positions of authority and who will obey the boss\u2019 diktat above anything else. Every democratic norm he gleefully shredded along the way is gone for good. Every thumb in the eye of transparency will now be official policy.\n\nBut right now those things are not what I think about when I contemplate life under President Donald Trump. This will sound trite, but primarily I think about my two boys, a 2-year-old and a 4-month-old. I don\u2019t have to explain this to them because neither would understand. But if I were to tell my 2-year-old what is happening, I\u2019d do it in Spanish because both he and his brother have deep Mexican roots that my wife and I want them to embrace and be proud of. It destroys me to know that they, that we live in a country that seems to have chosen as its leader a person who made frenzied racial attacks on my family\u2019s heritage the launch pad for his successful presidential run. I think about the African-Americans, Muslims, Jews, and Latinos in this country who now face life in a country presided over by a candidate who embodies white nationalism and memorably couldn\u2019t bring himself to disavow a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan. Children of undocumented immigrants who are U.S. citizens by birth have been told by their new president that they\u2019ll be deported. Refugees from Syria who were relocated here to escape war and violence will have another target on their backs. These are the people who will feel the consequences of this failure most acutely. I have one more thing to add: I am sorry. In my capacity as a media figure, I too often treated Trump as a joke, a bumbling incompetent, someone who obviously could not be treated seriously as a legitimate candidate for the presidency. Now I can only think that I was too hidebound by conventional wisdom, too comfortably out of touch to see what was in front of me. I succumbed to the sideshow element of this awful race more times than I can be comfortable with. I own this failure, too.", "194": "Leave a Reply Click here to get more info on formatting (1) Leave the name field empty if you want to post as Anonymous.

Chris Christie is rapidly losing support among some of his most prominent home-state donors and power brokers, who are either hesitant to back him or shifting allegiance to former Florida governor Jeb Bush.\n\nBush\u2019s aggressive moves to lock up the Republican Party\u2019s premier fundraisers threaten to undercut the Garden State governor before his expected campaign can get off the ground, while raising questions about how robust of a network of support Christie will be able to muster.\n\nBush has stopped short of directly confronting Christie by holding a fundraiser on his home turf. But behind the scenes, he has been quietly wooing, via e-mail, a cadre of high-profile Christie backers, including a group that attended a private dinner with Bush at New York\u2019s Union League Club in January.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known and admired Jeb for many years and I\u2019m obviously intrigued by his candidacy, or I wouldn\u2019t have had dinner or communicated with him in recent weeks,\u201d said New Jersey State Sen. Joseph M. Kyrillos Jr. (R), who chaired Christie\u2019s 2009 gubernatorial campaign and attended the New York dinner. \u201cTime will tell how things evolve.\u201d\n\nNew York Jets owner Woody Johnson, a onetime Christie booster, signaled his support for Bush on Wednesday when he showed up at a fundraiser in Chicago for Bush\u2019s political committees.\n\nFormer New Jersey governor Thomas H. Kean Sr., a longtime mentor of Christie who is no longer close to him, said in an interview Thursday that he hasn\u2019t decided whom to back \u2014 while offering praise for Bush.\n\n\u201cWhen [Bush] said he has strong views on issues and won\u2019t change them to win an early primary, it showed me he has real convictions,\u201d Kean said. \u201cThe Republican Party in the past has had problems with people who changed their views in order to win a primary, only to have to scramble back in a general election. Voters don\u2019t find that kind of behavior credible.\u201d\n\nSeveral Bush donors in New Jersey are also in the initial stages of planning an event in the state in March or April, according to several people with knowledge of the discussions. Bush may not attend, but his backers want to demonstrate his New Jersey support.\n\nSeveral top Christie backers said Thursday that he still has a strong organization of financial heavyweights both in New Jersey and across the country, and they disputed the notion that he is being undercut by Bush.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re doing fine,\u201d said Kenneth G. Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, who has pledged to devote substantial resources to advance Christie\u2019s bid. \u201cEverybody I\u2019ve called and asked has said yes.\u201d\n\nChristie allies do not expect that he will be able to come close to matching Bush\u2019s current fundraising spree, which is expected to bring in tens of millions. His team has sought to project a sense of calm as it makes daily calls to donors, arguing that much of the movement toward Bush is coming from loyalists who received appointments in the administrations of his father and brother.\n\nRay Washburne, the Dallas real estate developer leading the national fundraising push for Christie\u2019s political committee, said there is plenty of room for both of them.\n\n\u201cJeb has grabbed a good bit of the donor base, no question,\u201d he said. \u201cBut there is still a huge amount of the donor base available to get.\u201d\n\nA Christie aide provided a list of two dozen New Jersey major contributors committed to Christie\u2019s new political committee, including investor Finn Wentworth, trucking magnate Jerry Langer and Christie\u2019s brother, Todd.\n\nNew Jersey real estate executive Jon Hanson, who served as finance chairman for Christie\u2019s gubernatorial campaigns, said his in-state donor network is \u201cstepping up and contributing.\u201d\n\n\u201cI can see he\u2019s out there doing a good job,\u201d Hanson said of Bush. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to hinder our ability to raise money for Governor Christie\u2019s PAC.\u201d\n\nLast week, Christie held a fundraiser at the Greenwich, Conn., home of former GOP gubernatorial candidate Thomas C. Foley. In the coming weeks, he is planning to headline finance events in California and Texas.\n\nSo far, Christie has been raising money solely for his Leadership Matters for America PAC, which can accept up to $5,000 from individual donors. An affiliated super PAC, which can raise unlimited personal and corporate money, is expected to be launched soon.\n\nOnce it is, Langone said he plans to put in significant amounts of money. \u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m waiting for it to start.\u201d\n\nBut the investor also noted that he would be squarely behind Bush if Christie\u2019s Florida rival emerges victorious out of the GOP primaries.\n\n\u201cIf Jeb Bush is the Republican nominee, I will do everything I can to help him get elected,\u201d he said. \u201cJeb Bush is a good man. My preference is Christie for one reason: As I look at what this country desperately needs, I think he comes closest to giving us everything we need and want.\u201d\n\nThe reticence Christie has encountered among prominent party financiers is a sharp contrast with the more than $100\u00a0million that the Republican Governors Association brought in under his recent chairmanship. While Christie aides have credited the fundraising haul to his efforts, some RGA donors have privately said their giving was driven more by their interest in supporting various governors up for reelection.\n\nChristie\u2019s difficulty in locking down home-state support comes after his remarks about child vaccinations on a recent trip to London drew a wave of scathing criticism and alarmed some of his supporters. The governor had to make a series of calls to assure contributors that he supports vaccination for diseases such as measles.\n\nSpencer Zwick, Mitt Romney\u2019s finance chairman in 2012, said the attitude of former Christie backers at home is telling.\n\n\u201cKyrillos is a very good bellwether for what\u2019s happening in New Jersey,\u201d Zwick said of the state senator. \u201cIf Christie decides to run, he\u2019s going to need the support from the people closest to him to sustain him until he can get national Republican support.\u201d\n\nZwick, who has not committed to a 2016 candidate, added, \u201cPersonally, I have had my own reservations about what Governor Christie did at a key moment in the last presidential election and let it be known to him and others,\u201d a reference to extensive public praise by Christie of President Obama for the federal response to Hurricane Sandy in the late stages of the campaign. \u201cBut I do not believe he had bad intentions and I have moved on.\u201d\n\nAnother former Christie ally, New Jersey attorney Lawrence E. Bathgate II, hosted the Jan. 8 dinner in New York to introduce Bush to some of Christie\u2019s top supporters.\n\nBathgate had been in Christie\u2019s camp for years, but their relationship publicly soured after Christie\u2019s administration pursued a plan to build protective dunes on the state\u2019s coastline where Bathgate has an oceanfront home.\n\nIn an interview, though, Bathgate said his reservations about Christie began when he embraced Obama during his visit to the hurricane-battered state. He also expressed concern about more recent events, including the ongoing inquiry into the closing of traffic lanes leading to the George Washington Bridge.\n\n\u201cI know he wanted to work with President Obama on Sandy, but that doesn\u2019t mean you have to put your arm around him and hug him,\u201d said Bathgate, a former finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. \u201cThat took the election and Mitt Romney off the front page. Then you see him a couple years later flying around on Jerry Jones\u2019s jet, jumping up and down like he is a seventh grader. He\u2019s going to have to answer for all of that, and for Bridgegate.\u201d", "197": "Wednesday 9 November 2016 by Pete Redfern Washington Home Depot store receives order for five-thousand gallons of gold exterior paint \nThe Washington DC branch of the famous chain of home improvement superstores received an unusual and baffling phone call late last night. \nStore manager Chuck Williams told reporters, \u201cWe received a telephone call just before closing last night from a very excited gentleman, placing an order for over $120,000 worth of gold concrete paint.\u201d \nHe continued \u201cIt was quite a hurried conversation, and I couldn\u2019t catch everything he said, but I did hear the caller say something cryptic about turning a white house gold. \n\u201cI honestly have no idea what he could have meant, perhaps it was a riddle.

By trying to suspend Russia from the council, the flagrant intent is to discredit and further demonize. The 47-member UNHRC, based in Geneva, is the United Nations\u0092 premier inter-governmental forum on human rights. Members are selected on a rotational basis. On Friday, 14 seats on the council are up for renewal.\nThis week 80 mainly Western non-governmental organizations associated with human rights reportedly urged the UNHRC to drop Russia\u0092s membership, citing allegations of war crimes committed during military operations to capture the Syrian city of Aleppo.\nOver 80 NGOs call for Russia to be dropped from UN rights council over Syria https://t.co/uKTfWXWOLn\n\u0097 RT (@RT_com) 24 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2016 \u0433. Among the anti-Russia lobby were US-based and George Soros-funded Human Rights Watch. Notably, billionaire financier Soros is an open advocate for regime change in Russia.\nThe campaign to undermine Russia at the UNHRC was preceded last week when Britain \u0096 also a member of the council \u0096 convened a summit in Geneva. The council issued a resolution which pointedly condemned bombing of civilians in Syria, and implicitly laid the blame on Russia and allied Syrian state forces.\nRussia\u0092s permanent representative in Geneva Alexey Borodavkin rebuked the UNHRC for a one-sided, politicized statement, which he said sought to solely impugn Russia and Syria. He noted the rank hypocrisy of the United States, Britain and France, along with Gulf Arab states, which lobbied for the resolution.\nRadar data proves Belgian F-16s attacked village near Aleppo, killing 6 - Russian military https://t.co/Aj8mgT39ri pic.twitter.com/XHU4ljZb4H\n\u0097 RT (@RT_com) 20 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2016 \u0433. These states have been arming and funding terrorist groups in Syria since the eruption of the war in March 2011. They are also sending their air forces on illegal bombing raids across the country \u0096 in the name of \u0093fighting terrorism\u0094 \u0096 which has resulted in hundreds of civilian casualties and the destruction of social infrastructure, such as roads, bridges, public buildings and residential homes.\nIn recent months, warplanes dispatched by the US, France and Belgium (the latter two current members of the UNHRC) have carried out air strikes on Syria causing dozens of civilian casualties.\nSo, of course, Western-orchestrated claims against Russia over alleged human rights violations in Syria are patently hypocritical and belie their own criminality.\nThe contrived effort to delist Russia from the UNHRC has the same hallmark as other Western media campaigns to discredit Moscow, such as the banning of Russian athletes from the Rio Olympics on dubious drug-abuse charges, or the pseudo-probe into the downing of the Malaysian airliner in 2014 over Ukraine, or overblown claims that Russian aggression is threatening the security of Europe. We can also include baseless accusations made by shadowy US intelligence agencies that Russia is hacking into computer systems to somehow disrupt the American presidential elections next month.\nSaudi Arabia poised to be reelected to UN Human Rights Council https://t.co/sqWeSwjg48 #UNHR #SaudiArabia #humanrights\n\u0097 RT (@RT_com) 27 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2016 \u0433. The UNHRC debacle is one strand in a bundle of psychological operations aimed at isolating, demonizing and delegitimizing Russia.\nPerhaps the knock out absurdity in the latest rush by the Western lynch mob is the relation of Britain and Saudi Arabia, both of which are current members of the UNHRC seeking renewal of their seats.\nThat Saudi Arabia \u0096 widely seen as the most repressive regime on Earth \u0096 is even a member of the prestigious Geneva council is due to Britain engaging in underhand vote rigging to help its oil-rich ally gain a seat, according to documents released last year by WikiLeaks.\nA Saudi-led military coalition continues to slaughter thousands of Yemeni civilians by bombing schools, hospitals, mosques, marketplaces, funeral halls, factories and residential homes. Human rights groups like HRW and UN agencies are well aware of this Saudi campaign of mass murder in Yemen. It is also well documented that US, British, French and German weaponry worth billions of dollars is assisting the Saudi regime in its war crimes. That makes these Western states fully complicit.\nMoscow summons Belgian ambassador, presents data on F-16s bombing of Syrian civilians https://t.co/WzwvworaZd pic.twitter.com/cHlKvzaeUD\n\u0097 RT (@RT_com) 21 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2016 \u0433. Germany, for example, which is also a current member of the UNHRC, has seen its arms exports to Saudi Arabia jump by 250 percent over the past two years, according to a report last week.\nBritain, the ringleader of the media campaign to denigrate Russia in Geneva, has sold over $4 billion worth of armaments to Saudi Arabia since the oil kingdom launched its aggression on its southern neighbor in March 2015. Even while Saudi Arabia is committing the most egregious crimes against humanity, the British government continues to send Royal Air Force pilots to help train Saudi counterparts, brazenly denying that there is any breach of international law.\nThere is little or no protest from the 80 NGO rights groups about these applicant states to the next cohort of the UNHRC.\nThe hypocrisy and double standards of serial human rights violators make their condemnations against Russia null and void.\nImportantly too, is to not merely rebut the accusers as hypocrites, but to also elucidate the anti-Russia claims as fabrications.\nThe information that Western governments, rights groups and media base their claims of Russia bombing civilians is garnered from entirely dubious and partisan sources. Endless reports on Syria and the battle for the northern city of Aleppo broadcast by multibillion dollar Western news organizations are based, incongruously, either on claims issued by the British-located so-called Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, or by \u0093activist\u0094 groups within terrorist-held east Aleppo, which are funded by Western governments, such as the purported \u0093rescue workers\u0094 of the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center.\nBREAKING: UN Human Rights Council votes to open probe into #Aleppo \u0091war crimes\u0092 https://t.co/xrdojTxO3v pic.twitter.com/2gKhTiMovH\n\u0097 RT (@RT_com) 21 \u043e\u043a\u0442\u044f\u0431\u0440\u044f 2016 \u0433. In other words, Western governments, media, rights groups, and, sadly, UN agencies are promulgating an anti-Russia narrative that is recycled terrorist propaganda.Good proof of this is seen on the TV station called \u0093Free Syria\u0094 broadcast across the Middle East and North Africa on Saudi-owned satellite platform ArabSat.\nFree Syria is a crude propaganda channel funded by the Saudi monarchy. It features jingoistic images of Saudi King Salman, along with Saudi troops, warplanes and tanks.\nFree Syria also features links to the militant group Ahrar al-Sham, which is implicated in countless terrorist crimes along with Nusra and ISIS. Bearded militants are routinely shown firing mortars while shouting Islamist slogans.\nAnother regular contributor to the images and \u0093reports\u0094 on this Saudi-funded, terrorist-supporting channel are the White Helmets and the Aleppo Media Center. Thus, on this publicly available \u0093Free Syria\u0094 channel what we see in stark reality is how state sponsor, terrorist networks and propaganda machine come together in a self-incriminating amalgam.\nWhat is even more damning is that the same \u0093 information\u0094 is disseminated \u0096 albeit in a more polished form \u0096 through Western news outlets, such as CNN, BBC, France 24 and a gamut of supposedly respectable newspapers, like the New York Times and British Guardian.\nIt\u0092s an astounding feat how reality can be so inverted. Russia\u0092s military is legally justified in assisting the allied sovereign government of Syria to defeat a covert war to topple the state. That war is a criminal enterprise fueled by Washington, London and Paris through the deployment of myriad terrorist proxies.\nAnd to add insult to injury, these terrorist-sponsoring rogue states then turn around and accuse Russia at a UN Human Rights Council based on propaganda sourced from their terrorist proxies.\nThe utter insanity of it all. But maybe the Western lynch mob will eventually get hoisted on their own coiling ropes of deception.", "199": "Bernie Sanders has thrown his support behind Hilary Clinton, but it remains to be seen whether his base will follow his lead.\n\nSupporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders, (I) of Vermont, march during a protest in downtown on Sunday, in Philadelphia. The Democratic National Convention starts Monday in Philadelphia.\n\nAmid lingering angst over the primary process, Bernie Sanders has a chance to encourage his supporters to embrace party unity.\n\nSanders is set to meet privately with supporters Monday before the start of the Democratic National Convention. Sanders backers have expressed frustration over the nominating procedures, the party platform and party leadership, with some suggesting they may protest or take action on the floor. But the Vermont Senator has struck a positive message in recent interviews, expressing his support for Hillary Clinton.\n\n\"I'm proud that, in the Democratic platform that was passed a few weeks ago, we are making some real progress,\" Sanders said on CNN Sunday. He added: \"My focus right now is defeating (Donald) Trump, electing Clinton, electing progressive candidates around this country and focusing on the issues that matter the most to working families.\"\n\nEfforts to promote party togetherness were not helped by the publication last week of thousands of hacked emails, some of which suggested the DNC was favoring Clinton during the primary season. For many Sanders fans, the messages proved that their concerns about party officials preferring Clinton were correct. While party chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz is stepping down soon, she will still have a convention role, which could draw jeers from Sanders delegates.\n\n\"Democrats had great fun chortling over last week\u2019s less-than-smooth Republican convention \u2013 the 'Never Trump' revolt, the plagiarism, the booing, the high-profile GOP no-shows,\" The Christian Science Monitor's Linda Feldmann reports.\u00a0\"Now, it appears that Donald Trump and the Republicans may have the last laugh, as thousands of pro-Sanders demonstrators descend upon Philadelphia to protest the Democratic establishment \u2013 including Clinton\u2019s perceived deficits as a progressive.\"\n\nAt a meeting of the DNC credentials committee Sunday, comments praising Wasserman Schultz were met with laughter by some Sanders supporters. At a committee meeting the previous day, Sanders backers shouted \"shame, shame, shame\" as amendments to abolish or limit superdelegates in future nominating competitions were voted down.\n\nSome Sanders delegates feel the Clinton campaign is not taking their policy concerns seriously. At a news conference Sunday, Sanders delegate Norman Solomon, 65, of Point Reyes Station, California, said many of Sanders' liberal supporters were disappointed in Clinton's vice presidential pick of Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine. He said most viewed Kaine as not progressive enough and that there had been discussion about a variety of protest actions at the convention, including walking out.\n\n\"We've got to challenge the corporate power in the Democratic Party represented by Hillary Clinton today,\" Solomon said.\n\nStill, Sanders delegate Courtney Rowe, 34, from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, said \"we are not here to disrupt for the purpose of disruption.\" She said she was not currently planning on any action and wanted to hear from Sanders.\n\nSanders, who endorsed Clinton two weeks ago after a long-fought primary, has sought to find common ground around the party platform and rules. He successfully won major platform concessions, including a $15 federal minimum wage, abolishing the death penalty and breaking up large Wall Street banks. And at the DNC rules committee the two sides agreed on a \"unity commission\" that will review changes to the nominating process, including limiting the role of superdelegates.\n\nAfter the unity commission agreement, Sanders supporters seeking to pass amendments to abolish or curtail superdelegates opted against pursuing convention floor fights on the issue.\n\nSanders has made clear that he would like to see a full roll call vote at the convention, so that his delegates can show their support.", "200": "A verdict in 2017 could have sweeping consequences for tech startups.", "201": "By Vin Armani You know the state is in trouble when they\u2019re afraid of one man with an Internet connection.

Zervos, accompanied at a Los Angeles press conference by attorney Gloria Allred, said she was later offered a lower-paying job at a Trump golf course.\n\n\u201cYou do not have the right to treat women as sexual objects just because you are a star,\u201d Zervos said at the press conference, addressing Trump.\n\nLate Friday, the Trump campaign released a statement purporting to be from statement in which a cousin of Zervos said he was \"shocked and bewildered\" by her account.\n\nJohn Barry of Mission Viejo, Calif., said in the statement that Zervos spoke glowingly of Trump until the real estate mogul rebuffed an invitation to visit her restaurant during the primary campaign.\n\n\"I think Summer wishes she could still be on reality TV, and in an effort to get that back she\u2019s saying all of these negative things about Mr. Trump,\" Barry said. \"That\u2019s not how she talked about him before.\"\n\nTrump himself issued a statement saying that\u00a0he \"never met [Zervos] at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I\u2019ve conducted my life.\" He added that Zervos had emailed Trump's office this past April 14 to ask if he could visit her restaurant in California.\n\nAllred, who frequently represents women bringing sexual harassment and assault claims, said \u201cmany more women\u201d have contacted her regarding the Republican nominee after a video emerged of Trump making lewd comments about women in 2005 \u2013 comments Trump apologized for, but dismissed as \u201clocker room talk.\u201d\n\nAllred said Zervos is not filing a suit at this time.\n\nEarlier Friday,\u00a0The Washington Post\u00a0reported on a woman\u2019s claim that Trump put his hand up her skirt and groped her at a Manhattan nightspot in the early '90s.\n\nAccording to the Post,\u00a0Kristin Anderson claimed that while she was at the Manhattan nightspot in the early 1990s, Trump slid his fingers under her miniskirt and fondled her.\n\nCampaign spokeswoman Hope Hicks called Anderson's claim a \"total fabrication.\" She said in a statement, \"It is illogical and nonsensical to think Donald Trump was alone in a nightclub in Manhattan.\"\n\nThe new allegations capped a tumultuous week on the campaign trail for Trump, who has faced a daily drip-drip of allegations even as he has tried to focus on Bill Clinton's female accusers -- and the massive leak of Clinton campaign emails by WikiLeaks.\n\nAs Zervos was making her accusations Friday, Trump was at a rally in Greensboro, N.C., rejecting all the allegations against him as \u201ctotal fiction.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have no idea who these women are,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe stories are total fiction. They\u2019re 100 percent made up.\u201d\n\nHe continued to expand on his argument that the claims are part of a conspiracy involving the Clinton campaign and what he calls \u201cthe corrupt media\u201d \u2013 in particular the New York Times, which kick-started the reports of sexual misconduct earlier this week. Trump previously threatened to sue the Times over allegations they published from two women who claim Trump groped them.\n\nOn Friday, Trump went after the Times again, suggesting the reporters were acting at the behest of billionaire Carlos Slim, the largest shareholder in the Times.\n\n\u201cNow, Carlos Slim, as you know, comes from Mexico. He\u2019s given many millions of dollars to the Clintons and their initiatives,\u201d Trump said. \u201cReporters at The New York Times, they\u2019re not journalists. They\u2019re corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and for Hillary Clinton.\u201d\n\nTrump then claimed the controversy was \u201ca total setup\u201d consisting of \u201clies spread by the media\u201d as a way to undermine his campaign. He went so far as to mock his accusers, making fun of one who told the Times he groped her on an airplane in the early 1980s.\n\n\u201cThe only way they can figure they can slow it down is to come up with people that are willing to say \u2018Oh I was with Donald Trump in 1980,\u2019\u201d he said, putting on a voice mocking his accusers. \u201c'I was sitting with him on an airplane and he went after me on the plane.\u2019 Yeah, I'm gonna go after you\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cBelieve me,\u201d he added. \u201cShe would not be my first choice, I can tell you.\u201d\n\nOne of the accusers who came forward earlier this week, Mindy McGillivray of Palm Springs, Fla., told the Palm Beach Post Friday that she was planning to leave the United States because she feared for her family\u2019s safety. She told the paper cars had been driving around her house.\n\nAs Trump ratched up his attacks Friday on the media and his accusers, Democrats have been seizing on the accounts as proof that Trump is unfit for office. On Thursday, first lady Michelle Obama launched a scathing attack on the billionaire and the comments he made on the 2005 tape.\n\n\"We have a candidate for president of the United States who over the course of his lifetime, over the course of this campaign, has said things about women that are shocking, so demeaning,\" she said. \"I simply will not repeat anything here today. Last week, we actually saw this candidate bragging about sexually assaulting women. I can't believe I'm saying that, a candidate for president of the United States bragged about sexually assaulting women.\"\n\nOn Friday, President Obama followed up, saying Trump was determined to \u201cdrag this election as low as he can possibly go\u201d and warned that \u201cdemocracy is on the ballot\u201d in November.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "203": "in: Government Corruption , Special Interests , US News The cross section of Hillary Clinton voters is a mixture of walking dead zombies, power hungry influence peddlers, money cartel thieves and establishment diehards willing to start a global confrontation to postpone an inevitable economic collapse. As for the first category; welfare recipients, government bootlickers and mentally deranged utopians survive in a subsistence existence or in a fantasy illusion. The corruption purveyors simply want to maintain their elitist system of institutional inequality. As for the tribe of international finance, their objective always remains the same. Pick the next stooge who can be controlled. Finally, for globalist who are frantic to continue their New World Order of worldwide oppression, the elevation of Hillary Clinton to the position of the mad hatter to achieve the mutual assured destruction that these Illuminati\u2019s masters of the universe require to purge the \u201cLittle People\u201d from the planet. Any opposition to this band of desperate and deranged desperados is portrayed as racist, xenophobic and defiant of the \u201cPolitically Correct\u201d secular humanism culture. Here is the fundamental point of the conflict. The abandonment of the cannons of natural and common law has produced a didactic ineptness that thrusts humanity into a technocratic prison of a meaningless existence. Dante\u2019s Inferno of basic extinction is the ultimate society that a capitulation to the rigged electoral fraud seeks to achieve. The bloody record of Killary Clinton earns her an especially prominent place in hell. Take your choice. She may descend into Level 7 , for \u201cThe violent, the assasins, the tyrants, and the war-mongers lament their pitiless mischiefs in the river, while centaurs armed with bows and arrows shoot those who try to escape their punishment\u201d or Level 8- the Malebolge where \u201cThe magicians, diviners, fortune tellers, and panderers are all here, as are the thieves\u201d. Of course this allegory of punishment falls on deaf ears for the Clintonistas . For them this blameless role model for social justice warriors can do no wrong. All the evidence and proof in the world is ignored or dismissed when your patron saint of the occult wears pants suits. The reason HRC is better known as Killary has a lot to do with the body count that follows her around. THE CLINTON BODY-COUNT and the \u2018CLINTON DEATH LIST\u2019: 33 SPINE-TINGLING CASES lists several of her enemies that dared defy the queen of mean. Now are these suspicious circumstances of such deaths just another right-wing conspiracy to bring down the Arkancide crime syndicate? To an objective investigator, engaging into an in-depth probe might just get one added to this long list. But why would a Clinton supporter care, she is the epitome of the liberated woman and placing her on the throne of feminism is far overdue. Accepting, if not savoring a little reign of terror is a small price to pay as long as the body count does not include your own person. During the French Revolution the sanguinary women, known as Tricoteuse, who sat and knitted while attending public guillotine executions have more in common with Robespierre than Marie Antoinette. These devotee libbers identified with the symbol of equality, while their crowned head of elitism disdainfully admonish the peasants: \u201cQu\u2019ils mangent de la brioche\u201d. Queen Marie Antoinette may not have really said, \u201cLet them eat cake\u201d but the regnant of the House of Clinton demonstrates throughout her entire life revealed her true sentiments; despise and contempt for the \u201cLittle People\u201d. The knitting culture of the zombies cult of progressive authoritarianism is at the center of the public psychosis that follows the dictates of Hillary Clinton. Their identity is so caught up in the myth of collectivism that the very spirit of individual liberty is a necessary causality to join the Clinton demon worship. Look to the fictional character of Madame Defarge penned in A Tale of Two Cities for a synopsis of all that is wrong with Killary and her followers. Charles Dickens presents this viewpoint of the quintessential monster. \u201cHer problem, it seems, is that Madame Defarge just doesn\u2019t know where to draw the line. As far as she\u2019s concerned, \u201cjustice\u201d for the fate of her family isn\u2019t just that the Marquis gets murdered. Justice should, she thinks, include the \u201cextermination\u201d of all of the Marquis\u2019s family. Given her druthers, Charles, Lucie, and even little Lucie would fall under the sharp blade of La Guillotine. As Madame Defarge exclaims to her husband, \u201cTell the Wind and the Fire where to stop; not me!\u201d (3.12.36). \u201cIt was nothing to her that an innocent man was to die for the sins of his forefathers; she saw, not him, but them. It was nothing to her that his wife was to be made a widow and his daughter an orphan; that was insufficient punishment, because they were her natural enemies and her prey, and as such had no right to live. To appeal to her, was made hopeless by her having no sense of pity, even for herself.\u201d (3.14.33) So it comes as no surprise that when \u201cThe meeting between Lucie and Madame Defarge makes this absolutely clear: Lucie falls on her knees, begging for mercy on behalf of her child. Madame Defarge stares at her coldly. She doesn\u2019t even stop knitting.\u201d This example of the dark side of human nature is particularly relevant and applicable when analyzing the gender iniquity of the wicked witch. For femininity enablement to champion such abuse from a coldhearted degenerate is the biggest disappointment of this election cycle. Society should never condone or provide consent for anyone, male or female; who is such a habitual sociopath. The influence hucksters do not pretend to be altruistic . They would support Lucifer if they thought they would gain the riches of this world. As for the money changers, they are already archfiends in the Synagogue of Satan. Lastly, the globalist\u2019s warmongers covet the mass eradication of billions to satisfy their lust for world transcendence. These three factions are the true irredeemables. The masses of the walking dead need to politically repent and seek civic redemption. This objective is not possible by voting for Hillary Clinton. If you do nothing else before the November 8, 2016 election watch the video, A Vote For Hillary is a Vote For World War 3 . No matter your ideological propensities, we all share a mutual objective. Prevent a nuclear war that will destroy all civilized life on the planet. After watching this presentation, every rational person must come to deal with the prospects of putting a psycho in command of the launch codes. Folks; Donald Trump is not the mad man. The schizoid is a systemic and immoral lunatic, who is ready to drop the beheading blade on all of America. Her similarity with Madame Defarge bleeds over to her decadent boosters, who are willing to sacrifice their family, friends and community for the joy of destroying our planet. For all the dissatisfied and frustrated citizens, who understand the colossal stakes of national survival intervene with any fellow acquaintance that has been indoctrinated to the propaganda of Hillaryland . Confront the zombies attitude and appeal to their individual self-interest. Put forth the prospect of not voting for Clinton, even if Trump would not be an option. Citizens will not be the only people voting. Non eligible people are being ushered into a ballot booth with predisposed programming to put Killary into the oval office. The establishment is revealing their real tyranny for any person, who is still alive and has the ability to assess the actual nature of this election. The power structure in ready to collapse and the global elites are prepared to start a world war to keep and protect their feudal system of coercion. Those who might survive will be the special and the anointed. The masses will be served up on the plate of expediency and necessity. Hillary Clinton has always been part of the gang of criminals, protected by the intelligence community, insider politicians and the legal system of corrupt lawyers and judges. Voting for her is a clear validation of pure mental illness. The fact that the discredited FBI is endeavoring to regain their credibility by reopening the criminal investigation into Killary Clinton\u2019s attempt to hide her family\u2019s pay to play scheme to sell out our country is dramatic. This development should provide ample reason to put any notion of voting for the diva of sleaze on hold. Thanks to the Wikileaks release of the illicit emails from the Clinton cabal, only a fool can vote for her. Come to grips with the prospects of knowingly elevating this lifelong criminal to become the commander-and-chief. Genuine national security cannot be scarified to allow a distrustful and compromised agent of foreign interests to become President. Killary is dead meat. She could never gain the confidence of the nation and her continued nihilistic conduct and her kleptocrat criminal violations cannot be tolerated or ignored any longer.

Newsletter Notifications Signup Form", "206": "The reporter's job is to \"comfort the afflicted and afflict the comfortable\" \u2014 a credo that, humorously, was originally written as a smear of the self-righteous nature of journalists. And so the justification for going after a public figure increases in proportion to his or her stature. The bigger the figure, the looser the restraints.\n\nAfter a quarter of a century on the national stage, there's no more comfortable political figure to afflict than\u00a0Hillary Clinton. And she's in for a lot of affliction over the next year and half.\n\nThat's generally a good way for reporters to go about their business. After all, the more power a person wants in our republic, the more voters should know about her or him. But it's also an essential frame for thinking about the long-toxic relationship between the Clintons and the media, why the coverage of Hillary Clinton differs from coverage of other candidates for the presidency, and whether that difference encourages distortions that will ultimately affect the presidential race.\n\nThe Clinton rules are driven by reporters' and editors' desire to score the ultimate prize in contemporary journalism: the scoop that brings down Hillary Clinton and her family's political empire. At least in that way, Republicans and the media have a common interest.\n\nI understand these dynamics well, having co-written a book that demonstrated how Bill and Hillary Clinton used Hillary's time at State to build the family political operation and set up for their fourth presidential campaign. That is to say, I've done a lot of research about the Clintons' relationship with the media, and experienced it firsthand. As an author, I felt that I owed it to myself and the reader to report, investigate, and write with the same mix of curiosity, skepticism, rigor, and compassion that I would use with any other subject. I wanted to sell books, of course. But the easier way to do that \u2014 proven over time \u2014 is to write as though the Clintons are the purest form of evil. The same holds for daily reporting. Want to drive traffic to a website? Write something nasty about a Clinton, particularly Hillary.\n\nAs a reporter, I get sucked into playing by the Clinton rules. This is what I've seen in my colleagues, and in myself.\n\nOne of my former colleagues, a hard-nosed reporter who has put countless political pelts on his wall, once told me that everyone in public life has something to hide. Who goes down in the flames of scandal? The politicians we decide to go after.\n\nThat may not be 100 percent true, but it's true enough. The act of choosing, time and again, to go after the same person has the effect of tainting that person, even when an investigation or reporting turns up nothing nefarious \u2014 and it's time not spent digging into his or her adversaries. The original source of alleged malfeasance could come from the other party, within a politician's party, or from the reporter's own observations and industrious digging. But two things are crystal clear: If there's no investigation, there's no scandal. And if there's no scandal, there's no scalp.\n\nThe Clintons have been under investigation for about 25 years now. There's little doubt they've produced more information for investigators, lawyers, and journalists about their finances, their business and philanthropic dealings, and their decision-making processes in government than any officials in American history. They've watched countless friends frog-marched into congressional hearings and, in some cases, to jail. They know there's a good chance that any expressed thought will become part of the public record and twisted for political gain.\n\nThe most absurd allegations against Hillary Clinton have been bookends on her public career so far: that she had something to do with the suicide of Clinton White House aide Vince Foster, and that she bears responsibility for the terrorist attack that killed US Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens.\n\nBut in between, there was Travelgate, Filegate, and Whitewater. Some were less legitimate than others. When Clinton surprisingly claimed that she and her husband were \"dead broke\" when they left the White House, it was because they had spent all of their money to defend themselves against an eight-year barrage of investigations.\n\nIt's understandable, then, why the Clintons have a bunker mentality when it comes to transparency. But their paranoia leads them to be secretive, and their secrecy leads Republicans and the press to suspect wrongdoing. That spurs further investigation, which only makes the Clintons more secretive. The paranoia and persistent investigation feed each other in an endless cycle of probe and parry. Along the way, the political class and the public are forced to choose imperfect sides: the power couple that always seems to be hiding something, or a Washington investigation complex that is overly partisan and underwhelming in its ability to prove gross misconduct.\n\nThis is, for Republicans, a reasonable strategy. They know that if they keep investigating her, it will do two things: keep the media writing about scandals that might knock her out, and turn off voters who don't want a return to the bloodsport politics of the 1990s. They leak partial stories to reporters hungry for that one great scoop that will give them the biggest political scalp of them all. But they also err in jumping the gun in accusing her of wrongdoing, which allows Clinton to defend herself by pointing at the folly of her adversaries.\n\nIn touring the country to promote our book in 2014, my co-author and I were repeatedly lobbied to assert that Clinton is a lesbian. One gentleman pushed the issue during a Q&A at a Barnes and Noble on the Upper West Side of Manhattan \u2014 one of the few places you might expect that kind of thing to get a rest.\n\nThe National Enquirer published a story in April alleging that Clinton wiped her personal email server clean because it contained references to her lesbian lovers.\n\nMeanwhile, the conservative media are also convinced Clinton is preparing to wage a war on Christianity if she wins the presidency. But one thing revealed in her State Department emails is that Clinton shared daily religious reflections with her friends.\n\nIt's not just the out-of-the-box allegations that keep the media machine spun up. A year before Chelsea Clinton got married, Clinton staffers were kept busy by mainstream journalists who were absolutely sure she had already gone through with secret nuptials.\n\nAnd, on a more serious note, remember Benghazi flu? Many political opponents and members of the media were unable to accept the idea that Clinton was forced to cancel planned Senate testimony on Benghazi because she'd suffered a concussion. Now, three years later, it seems ridiculous to think that Clinton was making an excuse \u2014 she's since testified on both sides of the Hill \u2014 or that she suffered, as Karl Rove suggested, brain damage. And if she was making up the concussion to avoid testifying, how did she suffer brain damage from a fake fall?\n\nThe conservative media echo chamber, which bounces innuendo from Rush Limbaugh to Fox News and back again, ensures that the most damning story lines \u2014 true or not \u2014 stay alive. The Benghazi attacks are a perfect example. Terrorists killed four Americans. The conservative echo chamber seems convinced Hillary Clinton is at fault. The reasonable argument to make is that we shouldn't have been in Libya in the first place and the murders were a down-the-chain result of bad policy. But the right wing wants to prove that they happened because of Clinton's actions \u2014 or inaction \u2014 on security matters.\n\nThey've talked about security requests denied for Libya (never mind that the stronger contingent would have been in Tripoli, not Benghazi, and that there's no evidence Clinton herself was aware of the requests), a stand-down order that prevented reinforcements from arriving in Benghazi (never mind that they wouldn't have gotten there until after the fighting was done, and that even a House Republican committee found that there was no such order) and, most of absurd of all, that Clinton knew the attack was coming. This is how Limbaugh put it in May.\n\nThe freedom of the conservative media to make wild allegations often acts as a bulldozer forcing reporters to check into the charges and, in doing so, repeat them. By the time they've been debunked, they're part of the American public's collective consciousness. Or, as it's been said, a lie gets around the world before the truth gets out of bed.\n\nOne outgrowth of Clinton's terrible relationship with reporters is that journalists often assume she is acting in bad faith. There's good reason for that. Though she's added some new pros to her press staff for this campaign, her operation's stance toward the media was always a reflection of the way Bill Clinton's White House handled journalists.\n\nBack in the mid-1990s, Bill Clinton relied on a series of Machiavellian spin doctors to keep the press at bay. With the Clinton White House, the modus operandi was to stonewall as long as possible, lie if necessary \u2014 or just out of habit \u2014 and turn questions around on the questioners. After all, Bill Clinton once wagged his finger at a press conference and told reporters, \"I did not have sexual relations with that woman ... Ms. Lewinsky.\" He'd lied in a deposition, too.\n\nSo the press has plenty of precedent for believing that when the Clintons aren't forthcoming \u2014 and sometimes, even when they are \u2014 they're covering something up. And the Clintons, given the history of some-smoke-no-fire investigations launched against them, have plenty of precedent for being mistrustful of the press. The result is a brutally dysfunctional relationship on both sides. The Clintons believe the press acts in bad faith, and the press believes the Clintons' attitudes toward the press are evidence that the Clintons are hiding something.\n\nThat attitude carried over to Hillary Clinton's 2008 campaign, and to some degree her tenure as Secretary of State. The standard response to a reporter's question is not an answer. It is to ignore the question or to engage in a Socratic debate by asking a question in return. It's clear Clinton doesn't like the media one bit, as Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman reported last year.\n\nAt a July Fourth parade this past weekend, Clinton aides used rope to create an impromptu moving barrier for reporters, keeping them away from the candidate and voters. She treated them like cattle, and they responded by putting the video on television for the last three days.\n\nThe mistrust among journalists is a problem for Clinton. And as the media is an amplifier for the public, it's also little wonder that so many voters are inclined to believe she's often acting in bad faith. Most Americans say she's not honest and trustworthy.\n\nThis view, shared by many reporters and most of the public, makes it much easier to treat Clinton's actions as though they are uniquely sinister. Case in point: She made a ton of money giving paid speeches to people with business before the government. So did Jeb Bush, of course. But until Bush recently released an accounting of some of those speeches, the media had little interest in his dealings. Kudos to Ken Vogel of Politico, who did some digging on that for a story published Thursday.\n\nThe imbalance in assumptions about Clinton's motivations is another way in which the Clinton code has a distorting effect on the public perception of her. And it, too, is self-perpetuating: It leads Clinton to assume the press is biased against her, which leads her to treat the press poorly, which leads more reporters to assume she's trying to hide something from them.\n\nWhen Clinton keynoted an annual fundraiser for David Axelrod's epilepsy charity in June 2013, several major news outlets sent reporters to cover the speech. That was more than three years before the 2016 election. Every word, every gesture, every facial expression is scrutinized.\n\nVideo of Clinton ordering a burrito bowl at a Chipotle became the first viral image of her campaign. Reporters gave fodder to late-night comedians earlier this year when they made a mad dash to catch up as her campaign van rolled by.\n\nThis coverage of every last detail, of course, isn't a one-way street. It wasn't until a reporter was tipped off to the Chipotle visit that anyone knew about it. She craves the attention even more than she detests it.\n\nBut that, too, has a distorting effect. As with the royal family in London, normally private moments become part of a public narrative: her husband's affair, her daughter's wedding, the birth of her granddaughter.\n\nAll the attention has the effect of making Clinton seem, to the casual observer, hungrier for press than even the average politician. And there's no doubt that part of the love/hate relationship is an intense desire to attract and manipulate coverage. But Clinton understands that sometimes it's better not to be in the spotlight.\n\nThe best example of that was when she declined requests to appear on Sunday political talk shows right after the Benghazi attacks. Susan Rice, then the ambassador to the UN and now Obama's national security adviser, leaped at the chance to stand in for Clinton. Those appearances ended up costing Rice the nomination to succeed Clinton as secretary of state when many senators concluded she had lied about the origin and nature of the attacks.\n\nThe press has such fascination with the Clintons that the coverage would be there whether Hillary Clinton wanted it or not.\n\nFor someone who lost a big lead in the 2008 presidential primary and is ceding ground to Bernie Sanders right now, Clinton is given a lot of credit for her political acumen. Her detractors see in every move, including the birth of her granddaughter, a grandly conceived and executed political calculation.\n\nAnd Clinton plays into that by using the positives in her life for political gain.\n\nThat doesn't make her different from other candidates for the presidency \u2014 it makes her just like them. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie talked about his grandmothers, his mom, his wife, and his kids when he launched his bid for the presidency last week. Was that calculated to send messages about Christie to the public? Of course!\n\nThe best example, though, was the tear \u2014 the one that rolled down Clinton's cheek as she campaigned in New Hampshire after having come in third in the Iowa caucuses in 2008.\n\nThe New York Times's Maureen Dowd pilloried her for what Dowd saw as a window into the dark part of Clinton's soul.\n\nHow far political journalism has come from castigating Ed Muskie for crying to accusing Clinton of calculating that tears would help her win. She's not that good at politics.\n\nI take a dim view of the idea that journalists successfully anoint political winners. The media might have been in the bag for Barack Obama, but he didn't win because he got positive coverage. He won because he had better strategy, a better message, and better skills at delivering that message \u2014 in the 2008 primary and in the two general elections he won.\n\nThat said, the media can definitely weigh down \u2014 and even destroy \u2014 a candidate. The emphasis on a candidate's flaws \u2014 real or perceived \u2014 comes at the cost of the candidate's ability to focus his or her message and at the cost of negative attention to the other candidates. This is a problem for Clinton, and it seems unlikely to go away.\n\nHillary Clinton is comfortable enough to be a target for a lot of journalistic affliction and powerful enough that no one needs to comfort her from that affliction. But these double standards are an important factor to keep in mind when judging her against her rivals for the presidency. Whether they're fair or not, the Clinton rules distort the public's perception of Hillary Clinton.\n\nCorrection: This story has been corrected to remove an erroneous reference to the source of the original report on the Monica Lewinsky scandal.

As Hillary lost it, her campaign was caught red-handed, doing dirty tricks to pictures, and you\u2019ll love just how desperate they have become as they see this election sinking like the Titanic. \nRumors are flying after Hillary Clinton responded to the latest bomb dropped on her campaign, that thousands of government emails are on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. Everyone knows Hillary should have been indicted before, and she had a meltdown of sorts when Kristen Welker of Fox News asked, \u201cAre you worried this could sink your campaign, Secretary Clinton?\u201d \nWhile Hillary was walking away from the short press conference after the Weiner email story broke, she stopped and threw her head back and let out a creepy maniacal laugh . Fox News correspondent Jennifer Griffin found it really weird, saying it was like Hillary had lost it. She described Hillary \u201cstopping and throwing her head back and laughing, it was really odd.\u201d \"Are you worried this could sink your campaign, Secretary Clinton,\" a reporter shouts as HRC walks out. Clinton only lets out a big laugh. \n\u2014 Ruby Cramer (@rubycramer) October 28, 2016 \nHowever, Hillary Clinton was not really laughing. That was a public meltdown, and she is pissed off that an idiot like Anthony Weiner just cost her this election. It\u2019s so bad that the Clinton campaign was caught photoshopping the crowd at a recent Ohio rally, where Bill Clinton spoke. Bill Clinton rally Oct. 29th, red arrow shows a man (left) who was duplicated in photoshopped pic put out by Clinton campaign, indicated with red circles (right) \nThen, if all of that isn\u2019t bad enough, the Chicago Tribune, one of the most liberal papers in the country, had this headline yesterday: \u201c Democrats Should Ask Hillary To Step Down ,\u201d which was written by John Kass who was speaking from Hillary\u2019s real home state of Illinois. \n\u201cFBI director James Comey \u2018s announcement about the renewed Clinton email investigation is the bombshell in the presidential campaign.

However, that doesn\u2019t mean we can let up and sigh with relief just yet. \nHowever, we can be extremely optimistic that, after eight years and two elections that caused utter destruction for our country, we have an extremely good chance that Americans will reject Hillary and her criminal cabal. America was saved by Anthony Weiner, and it doesn\u2019t get any stranger than that.", "208": "(Before It's News)\nIt is fun to look at polls, and using such data, decide which candidate will win which state, and ultimately, which candidate will win the electoral college. A lot of people and organizations do that, and for this reason, I don\u2019t. I do not have access to polls that no one else sees. Were I to use polling data to directly predict outcomes per state, I\u2019d use a method like that used by FiveThirtyEight, and probably come up with similar results. How boring. It would be a waste of my time to try to replicate the excellent work done by Nate Silver and his team.\nBack during the Democratic Primaries, I decided that I wanted to get a handle on which candidate was likely to win, fairly early on. The polling based estimates were inadequate because most states simply didn\u2019t have polling data that early in the process. So, I invented an alternative method, which made certain estimates of how voters with different ethnic identities would vote. That method accurately predicted several primary outcomes, outperforming the poll based methods such as those used by FiveThirtyEight.\nAfter a while, enough primaries had been carried out that I could switch methods slightly. Using the same exact model, but primed with the results of prior primaries (that year) rather than my estimates of voter behavior, I used the ethnic distribution data for each state to predict the outcome of upcoming primary contests.\nOnce again, my method was very accurate, and once again, it out performed the polling based methods.\nSo, recently, I\u2019ve tried to apply a similar method to estimating the electoral outcome for this year\u2019s presidential race. But, it is impossible to use the same exact method because the entire thing happens all on one day. I can\u2019t use the election results from a handful of states to estimate the likely future outcomes in other states.\nI recognize that polling data is very limited on a national level. Things happen during an election season that probably change people\u2019s likely voting behavior, especially among independents. Solid states are rarely polled, and small states, swing or not, are rarely polled. Many polls are of low quality. Right now, for instance, fewer than half of the states have polls that were a) taken fully after the final POTUS debate and b) have an A- or better rating from FiveThirtyEight. If I allow the use of B and occasional C ratings for recent polls, and allow a few polls to include periods of time prior to the last POTUS debate, but only in states that are very strongly in favor of one candidate or the other (and thus likely to not move anyway), I can find 32 states that have sort of usable polling data. Interestingly, states with some of the more controversial changes happening, like Utah and Iowa, are not adequately polled.\nIn order to apply a model like the one I used in the Primaries to the current election, I used the 32 states for which there was somewhat acceptable recent polling data to inform the model (to calculate the regression coefficients) in order to then, separately, predict the likely voting behavior (Trump vs. Clinton) in all of the states.\nBefore I show you the map, however, I need to discuss something else.\nAbout a week ago the press, especially the somewhat more left leaning press, and various commenters, seeing much reaction to a series of events beginning with the NYT release of Trump\u2019s tax return and ending with the final POTUS debate, events which sandwiched the sexual assault tapes and accusations, collectively decided that a huge gap between Clinton and Trump was rapidly opening up and the race would end with a double digit spread, an electoral rout, and a big party.\nSoon after, I pointed out that this may not be correct. That polling data seemed to show, rather, that there was an expansion of the difference between the two candidates followed by a re-closing of the gap, with Clinton still leading but by about as much as before this temporary shift. To this I added a concern. If too many people assumed that the race was over and in the double digit range, perhaps there could be a GOTV backlash effect, or a funding effect, that would shift things to within shooting distance for Trump.\nI was not alone in thinking this, and I was probably right. The GOP sunk, via pacs, 25 million dollars into Senate races in response to the Democrats shifting from the national race to the Senate, which was followed by the Democrats shifting back to the national race in certain states, presumably recognizing that the polls were artificially spread. Indeed, some who criticized (arguing mainly from incredulity and good wishes) my admonition noted, correctly, that some of that narrowing was because a bunch of right-leaning polls had come out all at once. This is true, but it ignores that a bunch of left-leaning polls had made the formation of the Great Gap of GOP Defeat look a lot bigger than it ever really was.\nI say all this as part one of my preparation for what I\u2019m going to tell you below, which is not the news you want to hear. Part two is some logic I\u2019d like to bludgeon you with.\nConsider these points:\n1) True Trump supporters could give a rat\u2019s ass about sexual assault, poor debate performance, or tax forms. Donald Trump was correct when he said, weeks ago, now forgotten, that he could gun someone down on the streets of Manhattan and he would not lose support form his base. These people did not abandon him when he was heard to talk about sexual assault. If anything, they were energized by it. And, I\u2019m talking about something just shy of 40% of the voters. We live in a barely civilized asshole country.\n2) Please tell me exactly which Hillary Clinton supporters, who were going to vote for Clinton over Trump all along, are NOW going to pick Clinton (if polled or on voting day) that change from not being Clinton supporters to being Clinton supporters? In other words (this is a somewhat subtle point) which people who hated Trump became True Haters of Trump after the sexual assault thing? Almost none. They were already there.\n3) The third category of people, the undecideds (who are only lying about being undecided, in most cases) and the so-called \u201creasonable Republicans\u201d (of which there are very, very few), who could conceivably shift from Trump to Clinton are going to divide their voting activities between Johnson, a write in (as they are being advised by Republican leaders in some cases) or simply staying home.\nIn other words, over the last few weeks, no source has emerged that hands Secretary Clinton more electoral votes than she probably had about a month ago, and Trump is not going to have any, or at least not many, electoral votes go away.\nThose observations (part one) and that logic (part two) cause me to be utterly unsurprised to find out that an analysis of the electoral map I did on October 16th and one I did today do not show Clinton pulling farther ahead. In fact, the two analyses have Clinton being less far ahead than Trump now than ten days ago. The difference is in Ohio (shifting from Clinton to Trump) which is almost certainly going to happen, and North Carolina (which shifted from Clinton to Trump in this analysis) which seems much less likely to happen, and Arizona shifting from Clinton (that was probably wishful thinking) to Trump.\nThe point here is this, plain and simple. An analysis using a technique that has worked very well for me in the past shows that the difference between that moment of Maximal Clintonosity and today is plus or minus a couple of state. In other words, not different. Maybe a little worse. Really, about the same.\nHere\u2019s the current map:\nObviously, I will be watching for more data over the next few days. I assume there will be a spate of polls as we approach November 8th (the day Democrats vote. Republicans vote on the 28th of November). If so, then there will be convergence between my method of calibration and my method of calculation, and the model will consume itself by the tail and become very accurate at the same time.\nBut between now and then, perhaps that very small number of polls that are both recent and high quality will grow a bit more and I can do this again and resolve those closer states.\nBy the way, the \u201cswing states\u201d according to my model, the states where things are close, are Ohio, North Carolina, Arizona, and Georgia of those now in the Trump column. Those are indeed swing states. Numerically, the close states that are in the Clinton column are Virginia, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania.", "209": "Jubilee Year of Mercy ends on November 20.

First of all, the Catholics expect earnestly the 100th anniversary of Fatima. The 100th year started on October 13 and would end on October 13, 2017. As pope Benedict said during his pontificate on his trip to Fatima, the 100th year will see the Fatima secrets fulfilled. Then, we had all kinds of predictions recently. Let only remember the once at the time Jewish rabbis predictions of the year 5776, encoded in Bible codes according to some of them, that also appeared to be the 49th jubilee year since the retaking of Jerusalem. \"Nothing happened, again\" would say many. Much happened in terms that might be the last quiet year before the events. Then we have the enigmatic wishes on the last Christmas of both pope and queen as if that would be our last Christmas? The wordings were vague enough to draw firm conclusion, anyway they were said and stirred public interest. There are more predictions, such as of major Solar kill shot, that even president Obama signed orders in case it happens. The French foreign minister said of 500 days before climate chaos, days that expired last Fall. How much more mercy is envisioned by God, in what time frames? If the sequence given in Garabandal of Great Warning- Miracle - Chastisement is to be accomplished before the 100th anniversary of Fatima, it seems God's mercy towards the entire world would end in less than a year time. The only possible date for the Miracle in 2017 would fall on April 13, Holy Thursday. Let make a distinction, mercy to individuals who accepted God's loving call, NEVER ENDS! But God is a just judge at the same time. The Chastisement is predicted by too many prophecies and cannot be disregarded as nonsense. Moreover,t he world today is in a worse shape than during the end of the Cold War. I don't know what exactly will follow, there are variety of scenarios each of them having its own justification and logic to exist. May be a combination of them will happen in reality. What is exactly Great Warning, is it only what is said to be by numerous seers, far not only those in Garabandal? For me it should include ET-angelic component. Time will tell.

The efforts are supported by Shiite militias, known as Popular Mobilization Units, from Iran and its proxy Hezbollah.\n\nPhotos of Iran\u2019s Quds force Commander Qasem Soleimani visiting Shia militia units inside Iraq have appeared on social media since ISIS took over large portions of Iraq a year ago.\n\nThe defense official was unaware of any U.S. air support boosting the operation. It has been longstanding Pentagon policy to support only units aligned with the government of Iraq, but the line can be blurred as the chain of command for units operating in Iraq is not always known.\n\nThe spokesman for the Joint Operations Command, Brig. Gen. Yahya Rasool, said in a televised statement that the operation started at dawn Monday and that government forces are backed by Shiite and Sunni pro-government fighters.\n\nThe operation met fierce resistance from insurgents, who deployed five suicide car bombs and fired rockets to repel their advance on the city of Fallujah, about 30 miles west of Baghdad, military sources in Anbar told Reuters.\n\nThere were also reports of fighting around the provincial capital Ramadi, captured by Islamic State two months ago.\n\nThere were also reports of fighting around Ramadi-- captured by Islamic State two months ago.

Islamic State supporters said those advances were repelled by the militants.\n\nWhen Shia militia units launched an operation to retake another Sunni stronghold, Tikrit, in March, they did so without support from the U.S.-led coalition initially.\u00a0 U.S. warplanes only supported the operation when the Shia militia units backed by Iran departed the area.\n\nAccording to the latest coalition airstrike report, there were two airstrikes in Fallujah over the weekend.\n\nThis is not the first time the Iraqi government has announced an operation to retake Anbar -- where several key towns, including the provincial capital Ramadi, remain under ISIS control. In May, authorities announced an operation to retake Ramadi, but there has not been any major progress on the ground since then.\n\nThe forces arrayed against ISIS are varied, according to retired U.S. Army Lt. Col. Ralph Peters.\n\n\u201cThis is a real mish-mosh,\u201d said Peters, a Fox News contributor. \u201cYou have Shia militias -- not all of whom get along, by the way, Iraqi troops, police and some Sunni tribesmen. Iran is deeply involved in helping them plan and supervising the operation, but it is compartmentalized. It won\u2019t be Sunni tribesmen and Shia militias standing shoulder-to-shoulder. So coordination is going to be a nightmare.\u201d\n\nPeters said retaking Fallujah, a much smaller city than Ramadi and closer to Baghdad, will be easier. Going into Ramadi, where ISIS has been dug in for two months and likely booby-trapped buildings, will be a dangerous and painstaking process, he said. And there is one more tactic to worry about, according to Peters.\n\n\u201cISIS is very smart,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen they are attacked in one area, they strike in another area. It would not be surprising to see an asymmetric response -- perhaps a new attack on Tikrit or the oil fields in the north.\u201d\n\nHadi al-Ameri, commander of the largest Shi'ite force, the Badr Organization, told Iraqi television Sunday he expected the main attack on Fallujah to happen after the Eid holiday which starts later this week.\n\nResidents in Fallujah and Ramadi reported heavy bombardment of both cities early on Monday.\n\nIn a brief statement, Iraq's Prime Minister, Haider al-Abadi, vowed to \"take revenge from Daesh criminals on the battlefield... and their cowardly crimes against unarmed civilians will only increase our determination to chase them and to expel them from the land of Iraq.\"\n\nThe Islamic State group, also known by the Arabic acronym Daesh, seized large parts of Anbar in early 2014 and captured Ramadi in May. Iraqi forces, which had been making steady progress against the extremists in recent months with the help of the air campaign, scored a major victory in recapturing Saddam Hussein's hometown of Tikrit last month.\n\nDuring the past few weeks, the troops have been moving to cut the militants' supply routes and to surround and isolate Ramadi and Fallujah.\n\nRasool didn't provide any further details on the ongoing operations. By noon, the country's state TV reported government forces recapturing villages and areas around Fallujah.\n\nMeanwhile Monday, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for Sunday's series of bombings in Shiite areas of the capital, Baghdad, that killed at least 29 people and wounded 81 others, according to the ISIS-affiliated Aamaq news agency.\n\nIraq is going through its worst crisis since the 2011 withdrawal of U.S. troops.

The only thing it determines with any certainty is that \u201c the door was open prior to Mr Woofle\u2019s fall. \u201d \nThe investigation concludes Hookem was not close enough to the ante room door to open it himself, and so it is \u201c reasonable to assume that Mr Woolf opened the door whilst attempting to exit the ante room backwards. \u201d \n\u201c The investigation does find it unlikely that Hookem was in a position to be able to push Woolfe through the door, given where he was standing in the ante room immediately afterwards, but in the absence of an eye witness, it cannot make a definite determination .\u201d \nWhile the report lets Hookem off the hook, it actually finds a series of quotes given by Woolfe to the Daily Mail earlier this month to have brought the party into \u201c disrepute .\u201d \n\u201c Had Mr Woolfe continued his membership of the party, a disciplinary panel would have been convened to investigate these quotes ,\u201d the report concludes. Crying Woolfe \nWoolfe quit UKIP last week, abandoning his leadership bid, and branded the party \u201cungovernable\u201d without Nigel Farage as leader and the EU referendum to unite supporters. \nHe will now sit as an independent in the European Parliament. \nWoolfe stands by the claim he \u201creceived a blow\u201d from Hookem during an altercation at a private meeting of UKIP MEPs, where they were discussing Woolfe\u2019s rumored plan to defect to the Conservatives. \nWoolfe says the incident caused him to suffer two seizures, partial paralysis and the loss of feeling in his face and body. He says he issued a police complaint. \nHookem denies hitting Woolfe. \nThe fallout from the incident has continued with claims Woolfe has been warned about \u201cinappropriate behavior\u201d by senior party figures. \nHookem has also claimed Woolfe signed for \u00a3276 (US$300) in daily allowances at the European Parliament three times while recovering from his injuries earlier this month. \nWoolfe had been seen as a frontrunner in the race to replace Diane James, whose term as UKIP leader lasted just 18 days. \nAmong the other contenders are Suzanne Evans, Paul Nuttall and Raheem Kassam. \nAlso running is John Rees-Evans, who apologized this week over a 2014 claim that a \u201c homosexual donkey \u201d tried to rape his horse. He described the comments as \u201c playful banter .\u201d \nThe new UKIP leader will be announced on November 28. \nVia RT .

Kennedy and Antonin Scalia were born in the same year, chosen by the same president, live on the same Northern Virginia street and, in serving together on the Supreme Court longer than any other current pair of justices, have many times voted the same conservative way.\n\nBut one issue \u2014 how the Constitution protects gay citizens \u2014 divides and defines the two like no other. This week\u2019s historic hearing on same-sex marriage is both the logical extension and ultimate showdown in a decades-long argument that so far Kennedy has always won.\n\n[Here\u2019s what the fallout of a ruling could be in the various states]\n\nEach of Kennedy\u2019s bold and lyrical rulings on behalf of gays \u2014 \u201ctimes can blind us to certain truths and later generations can see that laws once thought necessary and proper in fact serve only to oppress,\u201d he wrote in Lawrence v. Texas \u2014 has been just as reliably followed by a meticulous and fiery denunciation from Scalia.\n\n\u201cThe court has taken sides in the culture war, departing from its role of assuring, as neutral observer, that the democratic rules of engagement are observed,\u201d Scalia answered in the Lawrence case.\n\nKennedy has written all of the Supreme Court\u2019s most important decisions on gay rights: protecting the civil rights of homosexuals in Romer v. Evans (1996), abolishing anti-gay sodomy laws in Lawrence (2003) and ruling in United States v. Windsor two years ago that the federal government must recognize same-sex marriages.\n\nEach was a steppingstone to the Supreme Court\u2019s consideration on Tuesday of whether the Constitution forbids states from prohibiting gay couples to marry.\n\nIf the pattern continues and the court renders a landmark ruling favoring gay marriage, it will likely once again be Kennedy whose words memorialize that decision and Scalia who will articulate the dissent.\n\nIt is not a conflict everyone would have predicted for two of Ronald Reagan\u2019s choices for the court. Scalia ascended to the bench in 1986, and Kennedy followed 17 months later. The two, born on opposite coasts in 1936, are consistent comrades on issues important to corporate America and in dismantling campaign finance laws they see restricting political speech.\n\nAfter Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. sided with liberals to declare the Affordable Care Act constitutional, Scalia and Kennedy united with Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A. Alito Jr. in a jointly written, 65-page dissent mocking the majority opinion and saying the entire act should be found invalid.\n\nKennedy is often the deciding vote when the ideologically divided court splits 5 to 4, but in two-thirds of those cases he sides with the conservatives.\n\nBut if they often arrive at the same conclusion \u2014 one obstacle for same-sex marriage proponents in the current case is Kennedy\u2019s allegiance to states\u2019 rights \u2014 Kennedy and Scalia could not be more different in how they view a judge\u2019s role.\n\n\u201cTheir different approach to gay rights reflects their more fundamental disagreement about how to think about the liberties protected by the Constitution,\u201d said Paul M. Smith, a Washington lawyer who was on the winning side in the Lawrence case.\n\nScalia believes the only freedoms that should be viewed as protected by the Constitution \u201care those that have been protected under American law throughout our history, defined at the most specific level,\u201d Smith said. Otherwise, the people decide.\n\nKennedy, Smith said, \u201cbelieves that each generation has the right to conceive of newer and broader forms of liberty that merit constitutional protection. He sees history as a guide but not a straitjacket.\u201d\n\nTheir battle is compelling, said Allison Orr Larsen, a William and Mary law professor, because it \u201cbrings to the forefront the theoretical question in constitutional law: How should courts respond to change when interpreting the Constitution?\u201d\n\nMichael Dorf, a professor at Cornell Law School and a former Kennedy clerk, said his former boss\u2019s decisions on gay rights were not constructed to lead ultimately to a decision on same-sex marriage. But they provided a foundation for how to view new constitutional rights \u201cif that\u2019s where the country moves.\u201d\n\nScalia, on the other hand, champions the cause of originalism, and Edward Whelan, a former Scalia clerk and president of the Ethics and Public Policy Center, said his former boss learned quickly that \u201cKennedy\u2019s judicial approach was not anything close to what Scalia\u2019s is.\u201d\n\n\u201cA basic tenet of originalism is that it\u2019s not the role of judges to impose their own moral philosophies,\u201d Whelan said. \u201cScalia understands the Constitution to leave the vast bulk of policy issues to the democratic processes and rejects the notion that it\u2019s his role to read his own views into the Constitution.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth remembering the differences among President Reagan\u2019s choices for the Supreme Court.\n\nHe fulfilled his campaign pledge to name a woman to the bench with Sandra Day O\u2019Connor, the pragmatic Arizona politician and judge who quickly became the court\u2019s center.\n\nScalia\u2019s selection was celebrated by conservatives eager to see a new method of constitutional interpretation forcefully advocated on the court.\n\nKennedy was a compromise, Reagan\u2019s third choice for the seat he once hoped would be filled by conservative Robert Bork, whose nomination was defeated in the Senate. \u201cThis was the Bork seat,\u201d said Smith. \u201cThings could have been much different.\u201d\n\nKennedy\u2019s views, Dorf said, were those of a \u201cmoderate California Republican.\u201d\n\nAlthough he never ruled for gay rights as a lower court judge, Kennedy expressed concern about the policy even as he upheld the military\u2019s right to dismiss gay servicemen. And Frank J. Colucci, a political science professor at Purdue University who has written a book about Kennedy\u2019s jurisprudence, recalled that Kennedy in a speech criticized the Supreme Court\u2019s 1986 decision in Bowers v. Hardwick that upheld a Georgia statute criminalizing sodomy.\n\n\u201cHe came about as close as you can as a lower court judge to saying it was wrongly decided,\u201d Colucci said.\n\nOnce on the court, Kennedy was able to say just that.\n\nIn the first gay rights case, Romer, Kennedy wrote for the majority in striking down a Colorado constitutional amendment. After some cities in the state began passing laws protecting gays from discrimination in housing, employment and other areas, voters through a referendum approved the amendment precluding such government protections.\n\nColorado\u2019s amendment, Kennedy wrote, \u201cclassifies homosexuals not to further a proper legislative end but to make them unequal to everyone else. This Colorado cannot do. A state cannot so deem a class of persons a stranger to its laws.\u201d\n\nThat began something of a call-and-response on the issue: Kennedy delivering the majority\u2019s opinion, Scalia replying with a scalding dissent, read from the bench for emphasis.\n\n\u201cThis court has no business imposing upon all Americans the resolution favored by the elite class from which the members of this institution are selected, pronouncing that \u2018animosity\u2019 toward homosexuality is evil,\u201d Scalia wrote in Romer. \u201cI vigorously dissent.\u201d\n\nIn Lawrence, Kennedy got the chance to reverse the court\u2019s decision on sodomy, and did: \u201cBowers was not correct when it was decided and it is not correct today.\u201d Private, homosexual conduct between consenting adults, he wrote, \u201cinvolves liberty of the person both in its spatial and more transcendent dimensions.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Connor wrote a concurring opinion to say the ruling did not touch on the matter of whether gays would be able to marry.\n\nScalia wrote that homosexuals should be free to promote their cause through democratic means, but \u201cmany Americans do not want persons who openly engage in homosexual conduct as partners in their business, as scoutmasters for their children, as teachers in their children\u2019s schools, or as boarders in their home.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey view this as protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe court views it as \u2018discrimination.\u2019\u2009\u201d\n\nTwo years ago, in Windsor, Kennedy wrote that the federal government\u2019s refusal to offer the same government benefits available to heterosexual couples to legally married gay couples tells \u201call the world that their otherwise valid marriages are unworthy\u201d and \u201chumiliates\u201d their children.\n\nAgain, Scalia blasted the decision, saying the majority was merely being coy in saying the decision did not address whether states are required to give licenses for same-sex marriage.\n\n\u201cBy formally declaring anyone opposed to same-sex marriage an enemy of human decency, the majority arms well every challenger to a state law restricting marriage to its traditional definition,\u201d he wrote.\n\nMost federal courts have taken Scalia literally.\n\n\u201cThe court agrees with Justice Scalia\u2019s interpretation of Windsor,\u201d wrote U.S. District Judge Robert J. Shelby of Salt Lake City.\n\nShelby\u2019s decision to strike a marriage ban in Utah was the first such ruling following Windsor and began the path that continues to Tuesday\u2019s oral arguments, and will end with the court\u2019s decision in June.\n\n40 years later: \u201cI\u2019ve got the license and the faggot letter\u201d\n\nThe right finds a voice on same-sex marriage\n\nGay rights, religious rights and a compromise in an unlikely place: Utah", "213": "WATCH: CNN Hack Humiliates Self, Tells Viewers U.S. Reps Are Term-Limited Already (They\u2019re Not) \nThat breakdown in communication in Washington is exactly what has fueled the rise of Trump .

Anthony Weiner Sends Apology Sext To Entire Clinton Campaign BROOKLYN, NY\u2014In response to the FBI\u2019s announcement that its investigation of him had produced new evidence that could pertain to its probe of the Democratic presidential nominee, Anthony Weiner reportedly sent an apology sext early Monday morning to the entire Hillary Clinton campaign. ", "215": "WASHINGTON -- Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush will lay out a vision of American foreign policy on Wednesday aimed at pushing his nascent 2016 presidential campaign out of the shadow of his father and brother, two former presidents who waged overseas wars.\n\n\"I love my father and my brother \u2026 But I am my own man \u2013- and my views are shaped by my own thinking and own experiences,\" Bush will say in a speech to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs, according to excerpts provided to reporters late Tuesday night.\n\nIn his first major foreign policy address, the likely 2016 Republican front-runner will make the case for increased military spending so America can \"project power and enforce peaceful stability in far-off areas of the globe.\" He will also criticize President Barack Obama's foreign policy, calling it \"inconsistent and indecisive.\"\n\n\"Having a military that is equal to any threat ... makes it less likely that we will need to put our men and women in uniform in harm\u2019s way,\" Bush plans to tell attendees, adding that he believes \"fundamentally, that weakness invites war\u2026 and strength encourages peace.\"\n\nThe idea that a bigger U.S. military would act as a bigger deterrent to potential foes is one that reached its apex during the Cold War, but has been repeatedly challenged in the 21st century by the rise of global terrorism and sectarian conflicts.\n\nThe Obama administration is currently working to devise responses to a number of unconventional threats to global security. Chief among them are the rise of the so-called Islamic State in the Middle East, and the Russian-backed separatists waging guerrilla war in Ukraine.\n\nFrom his speech, it appears that Bush would have America play a greater role than it already does in these conflicts. \"America does not have the luxury of withdrawing from the world \u2013- our security, our prosperity and our values demand that we remain engaged and involved in often distant places,\" Bush will say. \"We have no reason to apologize for our leadership and our interest in serving the cause of global security, global peace and human freedom.\"\n\nThis vision of America's role in the world directly contradicts the view held by Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, another 2016 potential candidate, that the U.S. should avoid involvement in foreign conflicts unless they pose a direct threat to American lives.\n\nBut even as Bush stressed that he would devise his own way forward, plenty of his foreign policies invite comparisons, not contradictions, with those of his neoconservative brother, George W.Bush, and his realist father, George H.W. Bush. \n\n One reason for this could be that Jeb Bush has consulted many of the same advisers his father and brother relied on to help them craft foreign policy while each was in office. The advisers represent a spectrum of conservative viewpoints, from the pragmatic James Baker, former secretary of state in the George H.W. Bush administration, to the fiercely ideological Paul Wolfowitz, who served as deputy secretary of defense in the George W. Bush administration.\n\nWolfowitz and Jeb Bush have held similar foreign policy ideas since at least 1997, when they were both signatories to a set of principles devised by the conservative Project for the New American Century, which were described by the group as a \"Reaganite policy of military strength and moral clarity.\" Other signatories include former Vice President Dick Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.", "216": "I worked for Kasich on Capitol Hill. Yes, he\u2019s very conservative. But there are a few surprises in there, and he\u2019s in Bizarro World.\n\nWith his surprising second-place finish in the New Hampshire primary, Ohio Gov. John Kasich has vaulted out of the pack of also-rans to become the latest hope of two distinct groups of people: Republican operatives fearing what Donald Trump\u2019s berserker candidacy might do to their party, and ordinary citizens simply hoping to have a sane presidential candidate to vote for.\n\nUntil this past week, Kasich has not attracted much attention, mainly because the current dynamic of media coverage encourages histrionics and preening. But by appearing halfway normal, as he did at last Saturday\u2019s debate in South Carolina, and not engaging in theatrics about carpetbombing, waterboarding, or ripping up treaties, he has become the default choice of those who would worry if Kasich\u2019s opponents ever got their hands on the nuclear switch.\n\nHe has the advantage (and disadvantage) of a long record. I had a chance to see him in action as I worked for him for 17 years on budget and armed services issues\u2014although I\u2019ve had no connection to him in over a decade, or to his campaign, and am now a political independent.\n\nIn the 1980s, at the dawn of his congressional career, many members of his own party considered Kasich a conservative bomb thrower\u2014he would offer his own budget, something back-benchers weren\u2019t supposed to do in those days. He has not changed ideologically or temperamentally\u2014his 2011 effort to roll back labor protection for state employees was too extreme and Ohio voters overwhelmingly defeated it\u2014but while Kasich has remained a staunch conservative, much of his party has lurched so far right it has entered Bizarro World.\n\nThis fact accounts for Kasich\u2019s reputation as a RINO (Republican in name only) and why it may be more difficult for him to win his own party\u2019s nomination than the general election. His apostasy in having Ohio accept Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act is unforgivable to Republicans who consider health insurance for the poor to be an instrument of Satan. Likewise, in 1994 he voted for an assault weapons ban, pure heresy for the burgeoning Ted Nugent wing of his party. Kasich\u2019s practice of occasionally dissing wealthy GOP donors who are accustomed to blind deference is considered a minus among the party\u2019s bigwigs.\n\nThose deeds might help, though, in a general election. So might his national security experience: 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee counts for far more involvement in that field than all his opponents combined. Refreshingly, as a congressman he avoided the kneejerk military interventionism that is now mandatory for GOP candidates. He opposed authorizing the Marines\u2019 mission in Lebanon in 1983; the bombing of the Marine barracks in October of that year and President Reagan\u2019s decision to quickly withdraw vindicated Kasich\u2019s stand.\n\nSimilarly, he opposed President Clinton\u2019s bombing of Serbia, which in his view amounted to a drive-by shooting with cruise missiles in a conflict in which no discernible U.S. interests were involved. He was also able to work across the aisle with Democrats to put a stake through the heart of the B-2 bomber, a Cold War anachronism, which at $2.2 billion a copy had become an unaffordable luxury.\n\nAs Budget Committee chairman, Kasich was also present at the creation of the first balanced budget since the Eisenhower era. While other factors, such as an avalanche of revenues from the dot.com bubble, set the stage for the achievement, he had a formidable job just to keep his own colleagues on task. The defense hawks were always itching to bust the budget caps with more Pentagon spending. And then-Speaker Newt Gingrich, who appeared to suffer from ADD, occasionally threatened to derail the difficult march to a balanced budget with novel and unvetted policy visions.\n\nThe general election downside? Just as there are legitimate questions about Hillary Clinton\u2019s receiving $675,000 from Goldman Sachs for three speeches, Kasich as a nominee would surely face scrutiny over his eight years as a managing director at Lehman Brothers. The investment bank\u2019s collapse in September 2008, the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history, nearly pitched the global economy into the abyss. Lawsuits to settle the dismantling of Lehman are still reverberating through the financial world. Ohio voters gave him a pass, but national inspection of his record would be more thorough\u2014certainly if Clinton\u2019s campaign had anything to do with it.\n\nStories occasionally surface about Kasich\u2019s anger management problem. As a former employee, I can corroborate those allegations, as well as his tendency to preachy self-righteousness that is a constant temptation of professional politicians. These are, perhaps, pardonable sins both in view of the tasteless vaudeville act being played out by several of his GOP competitors, and his own positive accomplishments.", "217": "On September 5, 2006, Eli Chomsky was an editor and staff writer for the Jewish Press, and Hillary Clinton was running for a shoo-in re-election as a U.S. senator. Her trip making the rounds of editorial boards brought her to Brooklyn to meet the editorial board of the Jewish Press.\n\nThe tape was never released and has only been heard by the small handful of Jewish Press staffers in the room. According to Chomsky, his old-school audiocassette is the only existent copy and no one has heard it since 2006, until today when he played it for the Observer.\n\nThe tape is 45 minutes and contains much that is no longer relevant, such as analysis of the re-election battle that Sen. Joe Lieberman was then facing in Connecticut. But a seemingly throwaway remark about elections in areas controlled by the Palestinian Authority has taken on new relevance amid persistent accusations in the presidential campaign by Clinton\u2019s Republican opponent Donald Trump that the current election is \u201crigged.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to the Jewish Press about the January 25, 2006, election for the second Palestinian Legislative Council (the legislature of the\u00a0Palestinian National Authority), Clinton weighed in about the result, which was a resounding victory for Hamas (74 seats) over the U.S.-preferred Fatah (45 seats).\n\n\u201cI do not think we should have pushed for an election in the Palestinian territories. I think that was a big mistake,\u201d said Sen. Clinton. \u201cAnd if we were going to push for an election, then we should have made sure that we did something to determine who was going to win.\u201d\n\nChomsky recalls being taken aback that \u201canyone could support the idea\u2014offered by a national political leader, no less\u2014that the U.S. should be in the business of fixing foreign elections.\u201d\n\nSome eyebrows were also raised when then-Senator Clinton appeared to make a questionable moral equivalency.\n\nRegarding capturing combatants in war\u2014the June capture of IDF soldier Gilad Shalit by Hamas militants who came across the Gaza border via an underground tunnel was very much front of mind\u2014Clinton can be heard on the tape saying, \u201cAnd then, when, you know, Hamas, you know, sent the terrorists, you know, through the tunnel into Israel that killed and captured, you know, kidnapped the young Israeli soldier, you know, there\u2019s a sense of like, one-upsmanship, and in these cultures of, you know, well, if they captured a soldier, we\u2019ve got to capture a soldier.\u201d\n\nEquating Hamas, which to this day remains on the State Department\u2019s official list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations, with the armed forces of a close American ally was not what many expected to hear in the Jewish Press editorial offices, which were then at Third Avenue and Third Street in Brooklyn. (The paper\u2019s office has since moved to the Boro Park section of Brooklyn.) The use of the phrase \u201cthese cultures\u201d is also a bit of a head-scratcher.\n\nAccording to Chomsky, Clinton was \u201cgracious,\u00a0personable and pleasant throughout\u201d the interview, taking about an hour to speak to, in addition to himself, managing editor Jerry Greenwald, assistant to the publisher Naomi Klass Mauer, counsel Dennis Rapps and senior editor Jason Maoz.\n\nAnother part of the tape highlights something that was relatively uncontroversial at the time but has taken on new meaning in light of the current campaign\u2014speaking to leaders with whom our country is not on the best terms. Clinton has presented a very tough front in discussing Russia, for example, accusing Trump of unseemly ardor for strongman Vladimir Putin and mocking his oft-stated prediction that as president he\u2019d \u201cget along\u201d with Putin.\n\nChomsky is heard on the tape asking Clinton what now seems like a prescient question about Syria, given the disaster unfolding there and its looming threat to drag the U.S., Iran and Russia into confrontation.\n\n\u201cDo you think it\u2019s worth talking to Syria\u2014both from the U.S. point [of view] and Israel\u2019s point [of view]?\u201d\n\nClinton replied, \u201cYou know, I\u2019m pretty much of the mind that I don\u2019t see what it hurts to talk to people. As long as you\u2019re not stupid and giving things away. I mean, we talked to the Soviet Union for 40 years. They invaded Hungary, they invaded Czechoslovakia, they persecuted the Jews, they invaded Afghanistan, they destabilized governments, they put missiles 90 miles from our shores, we never stopped talking to them,\u201d an answer that reflects her mastery of the facts but also reflects a willingness to talk to Russia that sounds more like Trump 2016 than Clinton 2016.\n\nShortly after, she said, \u201cBut if you say, \u2018they\u2019re evil, we\u2019re good, [and] we\u2019re never dealing with them,\u2019 I think you give up a lot of the tools that you need to have in order to defeat them\u2026So I would like to talk to you [the enemy] because I want to know more about you. Because if I want to defeat you, I\u2019ve got to know something more about you. I need different tools to use in my campaign against you. That\u2019s my take on it.\u201d\n\nA final bit of interest to the current campaign involves an articulation of phrases that Trump has accused Clinton of being reluctant to use. Discussing the need for a response to terrorism, Clinton said, \u201cI think you can make the case that whether you call it \u2018Islamic terrorism\u2019 or \u2018Islamo-fascism,\u2019 whatever the label is we\u2019re going to give to this phenomenon, it\u2019s a threat. It\u2019s a global threat. To Europe, to Israel, to the United States\u2026Therefore we need a global response. It\u2019s a global threat and it needs a global response. That can be the, sort of, statement of principle\u2026So I think sometimes having the global vision is a help as long as you realize that underneath that global vision there\u2019s a lot of variety and differentiation that has to go on.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not clear what she means by a global vision with variety and differentiation, but what\u2019s quite clear is that the then-senator, just five years after her state was the epicenter of the September 11 attacks, was comfortable deploying the phrase \u201cIslamic terrorism\u201d and the even more strident \u201cIslamo-fascism,\u201d at least when meeting with the editorial board of a Jewish newspaper.\n\nIn an interview before the Observer heard the tape, Chomsky told the Observer that Clinton made some \u201codd and controversial comments\u201d on the tape. The irony of a decade-old recording emerging to feature a candidate making comments that are\u00a0suddenly relevant to voters today was not lost on Chomsky, who wrote the original story at the time. Oddly enough, that story, headlined \u201cHillary Clinton on Israel, Iraq and Terror,\u201d is no longer available on jewishpress.com and even a short summary published on the Free Republic site offers a broken link that can no longer surface the story.\n\n\u201cI went to my bosses at the time,\u201d Chomsky told the Observer. \u201cThe Jewish Press had this mindset that they would not want to say anything offensive about anybody\u2014even a direct quote from anyone\u2014in a position of influence because they might need them down the road. My bosses didn\u2019t think it was newsworthy at the time. I was convinced that it was and I held onto it all these years.\u201d\n\nDisclosure: Donald Trump is the father-in-law of Jared Kushner, publisher of Observer Media.", "218": "Belgian authorities were searching for clues early Friday after police killed two in raids aimed at jihadists returning from Syria who were planning to launch a \"Belgian Charlie Hebdo\" attack, officials said.\n\nPolice were searching in Verviers, where the raid took place, and the greater Brussels area as part of a weeklong investigation that started well before the terrorism spree last week that led to 17 deaths in the Paris area. The Belgian operations had no apparent link to the terrorist acts committed in France.\n\nAnd, unlike the Paris terrorists, who attacked the office of a satirical newspaper and a kosher grocery store, the suspects in Belgium were reportedly aiming at hard targets: police installations.\n\n\"They were on the verge of committing important terror attacks,\" federal magistrate Eric Van der Sypt said at a news conference in Brussels.\n\nAcross Europe, anxiety has grown as the manhunt continues for potential accomplices of the three Paris terrorists, all of whom were shot dead by French police. Authorities in Belgium signaled they were ready for more trouble by raising the national terror alert level from 2 to 3, the second-highest level.\n\nPrime Minister Charles Michel said the increase in the threat level was \"a choice for prudence.\"\n\n\"There is no concrete or specific knowledge of new elements of threat,\" he said.\n\nThe suspects in Verviers opened fire on police when they closed in on them near the city's train station, the magistrate told reporters. There was an intense firefight for several minutes. Video posted online showed a dark view of a building amid blasts, gunshots and sirens, and a fire with smoke billowing up. Two terror suspects were killed in the shootout, and another was arrested.\n\nNo police were wounded or killed in the clash, which occurred at the height of rush hour in a crowded neighborhood of this former industrial town of 56,000 about 80 miles southeast of the capital, Brussels.\n\nBelgian news site L'Avenir, as well as Le Soir and France24, reported late Thursday that the government prosecutor's office said a dozen operations were launched against suspects across Belgium, in Verviers, Brussels and Hal-Vilvoorde. Some of those targeted are known to have returned recently from Syria.\n\nThe Belgian news site reported that, based on phone intercepts in the homes and cars of the three individuals involved in a shootout in Verviers, authorities believed the three were in the process of carrying out imminent attacks inside Belgium.\n\nThe French daily Le Soir is reporting that the investigations were launched against the Verviers suspects at least two weeks ago after they returned from Syria where they were thought to be involved in the fighting there.\n\nThe raids earlier Thursday included one on an apartment above a bakery in the eastern city of Verviers, authorities said. Authorities said the terror cell had ties to ISIS and was planning a major attack.\n\nEarlier Thursday, Belgian authorities said they were looking into possible links between a man they arrested in the southern city of Charleroi for illegal trade in weapons and Amedy Coulibaly, who killed four people in a Paris kosher market last week.\n\nThe man arrested in Belgium \"claims that he wanted to buy a car from the wife of Coulibaly,\" Van der Sypt said. \"At this moment this is the only link between what happened in Paris.\"\n\nVan der Sypt said that \"of course, naturally\" we are continuing the investigation.\n\nAt first, the man came to police himself claiming there had been contact with Coulibaly's common-law wife regarding the car, but he was arrested following a search of his premises when indications of illegal weapons trading were found.\n\nA Belgian connection figured in a 2010 French criminal investigation into a foiled terrorist plot in which Coulibaly was one of the convicted co-conspirators. The plotters included a Brussels-area contact who was supposed to furnish both weapons and ammunition, according to French judicial documents obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nSeveral other countries are also involved in the hunt for possible accomplices to Coulibaly and the other gunmen in the French attacks, brothers Cherif and Said Kouachi.\n\nIn Spain, authorities said Coulibaly drove his common-law wife from France to Madrid on Dec. 31 and was with her until she took a Jan. 2 flight to Istanbul.\n\nSpain's National Court said in a statement it was investigating what Coulibaly did in the country's capital with his wife, Hayat Boumeddiene, and a third person who wasn't identified but is suspected of helping Boumeddiene get from Turkey to Syria.\n\nFrance is on edge since last week's attacks, which began at the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo. The paper, repeatedly threatened for its caricatures of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad, buried several of its slain staff members Thursday even as it reprinted another weekly issue with Muhammad on its cover.\n\nAlso, defense officials said France was under an unprecedented cyber assault with 19,000 cyberattacks launched after the country's bloodiest terrorist attacks in decades, frustrating authorities as they try to thwart repeat violence.\n\nAround 120,000 security forces are deployed to prevent future attacks.\n\nCalling it an unprecedented surge, Adm. Arnaud Coustilliere, head of cyberdefense for the French military, said about 19,000 French websites had faced cyberattacks in recent days, some carried out by well-known Islamic hacker groups.\n\nThe attacks, mostly relatively minor denial-of-service attacks, hit sites as varied as military regiments to pizza shops but none appeared to have caused serious damage, he said. Military authorities launched round-the-clock surveillance to protect the government sites still coming under attack.\n\nThe Kouachi brothers claimed allegiance to Al Qaeda in Yemen, and Coulibaly to the Islamic State group.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "219": "Next Swipe left/right 8 classic football banners of our time Proof that sometimes the most entertaining part of a football match is the banners made by fans \u2013 here are 8 from over the years that have brightened up the beautiful game.\n1.

The Sheeple designation is apt for a society mired in a distorted reality of serfdom. \nThe New World Order moved from a century\u2019s old scheme to enslave humanity into a consolidated \u201c international community \u201d, when the central banksters organized the Bank for International Settlements, with the adoption of the Bretton Woods system of monetary management, the reorganization of nation states with the end of World War II, the creation of the globalist United Nations and the establishment of the centralized bureaucracy of the European Union. \nThe Trump movement is an existential threat to the established order that consistently adopts the agenda and practices from the demonic cabal of the NWO globalists. \nIt is because of this opposition to the transnational ruling despots that the vicious, deceitful and unending assault on Trump and his followers has been unleashed, since real meaningful change cannot be allowed that would reverse the systematic destruction of Western Civilization. \nREAD the Entire pledge of action that was presented as the 21 st century Gettysburg Address or watch the video . \nDONALD J. TRUMP CONTRACT WITH THE AMERICAN VOTER \nWhat follows is my 100-day action plan to Make America Great Again. It is a contract between myself and the American voter \u2013 and begins with restoring honesty, accountability and change to Washington. Therefore, on the first day of my term of office, my administration will immediately pursue the following six measures to clean up the corruption and special interest collusion in Washington, DC: FIRST, propose a Constitutional Amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress; SECOND, a hiring freeze on all federal employees to reduce federal workforce through attrition (exempting military, public safety, and public health); THIRD, a requirement that for every new federal regulation, two existing regulations must be eliminated; FOURTH, a 5 year-ban on White House and Congressional officials becoming lobbyists after they leave government service; FIFTH, a lifetime ban on White House officials lobbying on behalf of a foreign government; SIXTH, a complete ban on foreign lobbyists raising money for American elections. \nOn the same day, I will begin taking the following 7 actions to protect American workers: \n\uf0b7 FIRST, I will announce my intention to renegotiate NAFTA or withdraw from the deal under Article 2205 \n\uf0b7 SECOND, I will announce our withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership \n\uf0b7 THIRD, I will direct my Secretary of the Treasury to label China a currency manipulator \n\uf0b7 FOURTH, I will direct the Secretary of Commerce and U.S. Trade Representative to identify all foreign trading abuses that unfairly impact American workers and direct them to use every tool under American and international law to end those abuses immediately \n\uf0b7 FIFTH, I will lift the restrictions on the production of $50 trillion dollars\u2019 worth of job producing American energy reserves, including shale, oil, natural gas and clean coal. \n\uf0b7 SIXTH, lift the Obama-Clinton roadblocks and allow vital energy infrastructure projects, like the Keystone Pipeline, to move forward \n\uf0b7 SEVENTH, cancel billions in payments to U.N. climate change programs and use the money to fix America\u2019s water and environmental infrastructure \nAdditionally, on the first day, I will take the following five actions to restore security and the constitutional rule of law: \n\uf0b7 FIRST, cancel every unconstitutional executive action, memorandum and order issued by President Obama \n\uf0b7 SECOND, begin the process of selecting a replacement for Justice Scalia from one of the 20 judges on my list, who will uphold and defend the Constitution of the United States \n\uf0b7 THIRD, cancel all federal funding to Sanctuary Cities \n\uf0b7 FOURTH, begin removing the more than 2 million criminal illegal immigrants from the country and cancel visas to foreign countries that won\u2019t take them back \n\uf0b7 FIFTH, suspend immigration from terror-prone regions where vetting cannot safely occur. All vetting of people coming into our country will be considered extreme vetting. \nNext, I will work with Congress to introduce the following broader legislative measures and fight for their passage within the first 100 days of my Administration: Middle Class Tax Relief And Simplification Act. An economic plan designed to grow the economy 4% per year and create at least 25 million new jobs through massive tax reduction and simplification, in combination with trade reform, regulatory relief, and lifting the restrictions on American energy. The largest tax reductions are for the middle class. A middle-class family with 2 children will get a 35% tax cut. The current number of brackets will be reduced from 7 to 3, and tax forms will likewise be greatly simplified. The business rate will be lowered from 35 to 15 percent, and the trillions of dollars of American corporate money overseas can now be brought back at a 10 percent rate. End The Offshoring Act Establishes tariffs to discourage companies from laying off their workers in order to relocate in other countries and ship their products back to the U.S. tax-free. American Energy & Infrastructure Act. Leverages public-private partnerships, and private investments through tax incentives, to spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over 10 years. It is revenue neutral. School Choice And Education Opportunity Act. Redirects education dollars to gives parents the right to send their kid to the public, private, charter, magnet, religious or home school of their choice. Ends common core, brings education supervision to local communities. It expands vocational and technical education, and make 2 and 4-year college more affordable. Repeal and Replace Obamacare Act. Fully repeals Obamacare and replaces it with Health Savings Accounts, the ability to purchase health insurance across state lines, and lets states manage Medicaid funds. Reforms will also include cutting the red tape at the FDA: there are over 4,000 drugs awaiting approval, and we especially want to speed the approval of life-saving medications. Affordable Childcare and Eldercare Act. Allows Americans to deduct childcare and elder care from their taxes, incentivizes employers to provide on-side childcare services, and creates tax-free Dependent Care Savings Accounts for both young and elderly dependents, with matching contributions for low-income families. End Illegal Immigration Act Fully-funds the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall; establishes a 2-year mandatory minimum federal prison sentence for illegally re-entering the U.S. after a previous deportation, and a 5-year mandatory minimum for illegally re-entering for those with felony convictions, multiple misdemeanor convictions or two or more prior deportations; also reforms visa rules to enhance penalties for overstaying and to ensure open jobs are offered to American workers first. Restoring Community Safety Act. Reduces surging crime, drugs and violence by creating a Task Force On Violent Crime and increasing funding for programs that train and assist local police; increases resources for federal law enforcement agencies and federal prosecutors to dismantle criminal gangs and put violent offenders behind bars. Restoring National Security Act. Rebuilds our military by eliminating the defense sequester and expanding military investment; provides Veterans with the ability to receive public VA treatment or attend the private doctor of their choice; protects our vital infrastructure from cyber-attack; establishes new screening procedures for immigration to ensure those who are admitted to our country support our people and our values Clean up Corruption in Washington Act. Enacts new ethics reforms to Drain the Swamp and reduce the corrupting influence of special interests on our politics. On November 8th, Americans will be voting for this 100-day plan to restore prosperity to our economy, security to our communities, and honesty to our government. \nThis is my pledge to you. And if we follow these steps, we will once more have a government of, by and for the people. \nPublishing the entire list of all these positive measures, which challenge the elitist consortium of a criminal syndicate that impose a neo-feudal enslavement of humanity, documents the essence of the Trump vow of revolutionary nonviolent combat against the forces of satanic evil. \nThe ironic symbolism of presenting this restoration of national greatness at the site of the historic betrayal of the original American Revolution, one must not forget that Abraham Lincoln embarked upon the initial destruction of the legitimate States\u2019 Right essence that created the country. \nThis apocalyptic step, set into motion the underpinnings of a global empire of which, America was never intended to pursue. Let\u2019s hope that Donald Trump can rectify some of the damage done to the individual rights embodied in the Declaration of Independence. Gettysburg was not a victory for a union of free men, but was the launching of a lustful hegemony for an Imperium international order. \nOnly this contract with American citizens can offer any hope of reestablishing a legitimate administration of a limited national government.", "222": "Five candidates will be on stage Tuesday at the first Democratic presidential debate of the 2016 race in Las Vegas.

They are spinning up as we speak.\u201d\n\nThe email was sent out at 7:19 p.m. ET on Sept. 11, 2012, in the early stages of the eight-hour siege that also claimed the lives of Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and two former Navy SEALs, Ty Woods and Glen Doherty, private CIA contractors who raced to the aid of embattled State Department workers.\n\nAlthough the email came after the first wave of the attack at the consulate, it occurred before a mortar strike on the CIA annex killed Woods and Doherty.\n\n\u201cThis leaves no doubt military assets were offered and ready to go, and awaiting State Department signoff, which did not come,\u201d Judicial Watch, a nonprofit government watchdog said in a statement.\n\nParts of the email from Bash were redacted before release, including details on what military forces were available.\n\nIn defending the Obama administration\u2019s lack of a military response to the attack, Panetta told the Senate Armed Services Committee nearly two years ago that \u201ctime, distance, the lack of an adequate warning, events that moved very quickly on the ground prevented a more immediate response.\u201d\n\nThe first assault occurred at the consulate at 3:40 p.m. ET. The second attack on the CIA annex a little over a mile away began three hours later. Bash\u2019s email was sent approximately 40 minutes after that attack began.\n\nBash\u2019s email, which bore the subject line \u201cLibya,\u201d was sent to Clinton\u2019s then-deputy chief of staff Jacob Sullivan, Deputy Secretary of State for Political Affairs Wendy Sherman and Deputy Secretary of State for Management and Resources Thomas Nides.\n\nThe attack came in three waves at two locations. It began when a handful of attackers scaled the wall of the diplomatic post at dusk and opened a gate, allowing dozens of armed men inside who then set the building on fire. Stevens and Smith died after breathing in smoke while hiding in a safe room, and later died.\n\nHours later, a nearby CIA annex was attacked twice. Woods and Doherty died there while defending the annex from the rooftop. A team of six security officials summoned from Tripoli and a Libyan military unit helped evacuate the remaining U.S. personnel who were taken to an airport and flown out of Benghazi.\n\nThe Obama administration later falsely claimed that the attack was triggered by an Internet video that insulted Islam.\n\nLawmakers investigating the events surrounding Benghazi already had acquired the e-mail, along with tens of thousands of others related to the probe, according to Matt Wolking, spokesman for the House Select Committee on Benghazi.\n\n\u201cThe Select Committee has obtained and reviewed tens of thousands of documents in the course of its thorough, fact-centered investigation into the Benghazi terrorist attacks, and this information will be detailed in the final report the Committee hopes to release within the next few months,\" Wolking told FoxNews.com. \"While the Committee does not rush to release or comment on every document it uncovers, I can confirm that we obtained the unredacted version of this email last year, in addition to Jake Sullivan\u2019s response.\"", "224": "The Bentley administration, the Alabama legislature and the governor\u2019s Alabama Health Insurance Exchange Study Commission weighed many of the same issues their counterparts in other states did. How would they finance the exchange's operations? Should a state agency or some other entity manage a new marketplace? How heavily should insurance companies be regulated? Would it better for Alabama to exert at least a little control over Obamacare, or to just let the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services do the work?\n\nIf that was the case four years ago, no one told Alabama state Sen. Jim McClendon (R), a native English speaker who co-chaired Bentley\u2019s commission while a member of the state House of Representatives, which unanimously passed a bill in April 2012 to establish an Alabama health insurance exchange.\n\n \n\n \u201cNo. No. No. That was never, never brought up,\u201d McClendon said in an interview with The Huffington Post last month. \u201cI was unaware of that stipulation in the Affordable Care Act, and I would almost have to guess that anybody involved in this process was not aware of it. I was a little surprised when it came up eventually. Nope. I was the chairman of the commission and I was totally unaware of that.\u201d\n\n\u201cNever. It was never discussed,\u201d said Carey, who also worked with Delaware and Tennessee on their exchanges at the time, when he was a subcontractor working for LMI, a Tysons, Virginia-based government contractor. \u201cIt was never a consideration that they weren\u2019t going to get subsidies if they deferred to the feds. I mean, I was there at every commission meeting and I was presenting, \u2018Here are your options, here\u2019s what I think it might cost you,\u2019 and we did those type of calculations.\"\n\nI don\u2019t remember that coming up. I really don\u2019t. I really don\u2019t ever remember that ever being brought up as an issue... I don\u2019t ever remember anybody saying, \u2018Well, if we do this and let the feds do it, this is the trade-off down the road'... I\u2019m almost positive somebody would\u2019ve brought it up... During the time, we didn\u2019t know that. After the commission, that\u2019s when all that stuff started coming out. We were like, \u2018Oh, wait a minute.\u2019 That could\u2019ve really changed, obviously, the advice to the governor, because I don\u2019t think he would\u2019ve even said we\u2019re not going to do it if it was clear at that point in time, all the way back four, five years ago, that if you don\u2019t do this, here\u2019s the side effect. Because that\u2019s a huge trade-off.\n\nWren was the author of the health insurance exchange bill the state House passed in April 2012, and he championed a state-run marketplace until Bentley\u2019s final decision in December of that year to forgo a state exchange. Wren told HuffPost he still believes Alabama should have its own exchange.\n\n \n\n Wren claimed in an interview that he was aware, early on, of a provision in the law that would restrict subsidies to those who purchased coverage on state exchanges. But in a subsequent email, his account shifted. Wren first said that issue came to his attention in 2009, before Obamacare had even passed. In a subsequent email, he wrote that he had misspoken during the interview, and said he'd actually learned of this phrase in 2011.\n\n \n\n \u201cI believed at the time that for many reasons, including the possible favorable premium treatment to individuals purchasing from a state exchange, that Alabama should consider this over a federal,\u201d he wrote.\n\n\n\n Greg Wren, then a member of the Alabama House of Representatives, in 2011.\n\n \n\n There is little evidence to back Wren's claim that he was aware of the now-controversial provision in Obamacare during his state\u2019s debate over whether to establish an exchange. The former legislator could not offer an explanation for why his version of events differs from those of McClendon and the others interviewed for this article, or why it isn\u2019t reflected in official documents or media accounts from the time.\n\n \n\n \u201cAt this point I can only say is [sic] I remembered back as best I could,\u201d he wrote in an email.\n\nWren also acknowledged that he has no documentation from 2010 through 2012 to support his assertions that he understood the phrase \u201cestablished by the state\u201d could mean that subsidies wouldn\u2019t be available in federal exchanges. The Alabama legislature does not transcribe floor or committee proceedings, so no official record exists of the debate on Wren\u2019s bill.\n\n \n\n Wren was often quoted in the local and national press speaking about the advantages of state-run health insurance exchanges in 2011 and 2012, but HuffPost couldn\u2019t find any articles that cited him saying the subsidies wouldn\u2019t be available in federal exchanges.", "225": "Trump Proudly Declares: Most Of The People I\u2019ve Insulted Deserved It By Andrew Bradford on October 27, 2016 Subscribe \nArrogance is defined as \u201can insulting way of thinking or behaving that comes from believing that you are better, smarter, or more important than other people.\u201d In other words, Donald Trump perfectly exemplifies arrogance, and he just proved that fact yet again. \nAppearing on Good Morning America Thursday morning, the GOP nominee readily defended the insulting posts he\u2019s made on Twitter: \u201cIt\u2019s ok, most of them deserved it.\u201d \nTrump then declared : \u201cI believe in fighting back when people are against me, when they tell lies, you know, I have the power of this instrument and frankly sometimes I\u2019ll use that.

The conflict not only threatens the party's ability to make any realistic attempt at reclaiming the White House next month, but also previews the conflicts and divides that could consume the GOP for years to come if Trump loses.\n\nOn one side is Trump, who spent much of Tuesday lashing out on social media at his GOP foes, such as Speaker Paul Ryan and Sen. John McCain, and lamenting the lack of party unity. He's backed by conservative lawmakers including Iowa Rep. Steve King and the throngs of loyal supporters who attend his rallies, including the one here in Panama City, Florida, Tuesday, where he renewed his call for a government investigation into his opponent, Hillary Clinton.\n\nSome are even raising the potential of denying Ryan the speakership after the election.\n\nOn the other side is Ryan, who is devoting the full resources of his stature to maintaining a congressional majority. That dominance of Capitol Hill is suddenly threatened -- and not just in the Senate, where there are many competitive races, but also in the House, where the GOP majority was considered untouchable until recently.\n\nThe infighting -- sparked by the release Friday of a 2005 video depicting Trump describing women in vulgar and sexually aggressive terms -- isn't likely to ease in the 27 days before Election Day. Trump made clear Tuesday that if he loses in November, he won't go down quietly -- or alone.\n\nHe began the day with a series of shots -- taken over Twitter -- at Ryan, saying it's hard to do well when the speaker isn't supportive. He followed up about an hour later calling Ryan a \"weak and ineffective leader.\"\n\nAnd nearly two hours after that, Trump posed his most explosive tweet of the day.\n\n'Shackles have been taken off me'\n\nTrump continued his attacks on Ryan Wednesday during a rally in central Florida, where he said he's at a disadvantage when \"you have leadership not putting their weight behind the people.\"\n\nHe also complained about getting no credit from party leaders for his Sunday night debate performance.\n\n\"Wouldn't you think Paul Ryan would call and say good job?\" he said. \"It got just about the largest audience for a second night debate in the history of the country. You'd think they'd say great going, Don, let's beat this crook. No, he doesn't.\"\n\nTrump's turn on his own party may seem counterproductive -- it hardly allows him to improve his chances of catching Clinton. But it does allow him the satisfaction of vengeance against party leaders he believes have never treated him fairly since his stunning outsider campaign captured the nomination earlier this year.\n\nAnd by blaming Republican leaders for their failure to wholeheartedly endorse his campaign, Trump also opens up the possibility of a face-saving excuse if he crashes to defeat in November.\n\nBut the cost to the Republican Party of Trump's burn-it-down-around-him strategy is already high, could become more extreme and potentially leave the GOP badly damaged long after he has left the political scene.\n\nTo begin with, the estrangement between Trump and the party leaders is blowing open a gaping split between the party's grass roots and its establishment leaders that Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus and others worked so hard to bridge over the summer.\n\nIt is a divide that will be hard to overcome if Trump loses the election. Forging unity could be impossible if hordes of Trump voters blame party leaders for the defeat of a man who electrified the grass roots supporters in a way no other Republican has managed in decades.\n\nKing, the Iowa Republican congressman, warned Tuesday that a purge of party elites might be necessary, saying \"the establishment wing of the party could simply be amputated out in this effort that's going on right now.\"\n\n\"They've gone so far out on this limb,\" King said on the Laura Ingraham radio show.\n\nThe meltdown in the GOP is the culmination of forces that have been building for years. Intense antipathy towards congressional leaders over their failure to more forcefully oppose President Barack Obama gave rise to the Tea Party and sent waves of anti-establishment lawmakers to Washington in successive elections.\n\nTrump's adoption of a factually-challenged style of campaigning would have been impossible without the power of conservative media that has been building for decades and is now fused with the GOP presidential ticket through the role of Stephen Bannon, the head of Breitbart News, who serves as the CEO of the Trump campaign.\n\nTrump's turn against his own party could also reverberate in down-ballot races. Republicans have long known that their hold on the Senate was tenuous -- whoever ran at the top of their ticket -- but Trump's slumping poll numbers now threaten to drag down vulnerable incumbents too.\n\nAt the very least, a Trump implosion that cuts deeply into Ryan's majority could complicate the Speaker's already tough task of corralling his volatile majority coalition. If an anti-Trump landslide sweeps away House GOP members in more moderate districts, it could hand more relative power to the ultra-conservative Freedom Caucus and give him the same kinds of fits that it imposed on John Boehner, his predecessor.\n\nThe dilemma is especially difficult for Republican senators running for re-election. Some are rejecting Trump because of revulsion at his remarks among more moderate voters. But at the same time, they risk alienating Trump supporters in states's where the former reality star racked up high margins in the primary race.\n\nNew Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte fits into this category and her desperate effort to walk the fine line between condemning and embracing Trump during this election has become a symbol of the wider GOP conundrum. Ayotte finally said she could not vote for Trump after the video emerged on Friday.\n\nBut another star of the GOP, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, said Tuesday he's not yet ready to back away from Trump. Rubio looks certain to need Trump voters to maintain his narrow lead in his re-election race. But at the same time, if more explosive video emerges about Trump, Rubio, who has presidential ambitions in his future, risks being tarnished by association with the Republican nominee.\n\nAnother lawmaker in a tough re-election race who is hedging his bets is North Carolina GOP Sen. Richard Burr, who said that while Trump's comments were \"indefensible,\" he still plans to support him.\n\nFor her part, the turmoil consuming the GOP would seem to provide a substantial boost to Clinton's White House bid. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday found the Democratic nominee enjoying a 9-point lead among likely voters in a four-way race.\n\nBut her aides caution against excessive optimism. There's concern inside the campaign that an increasingly negative race -- which could only become darker in the days ahead -- could turn off voters and make them less likely to show up at the polls. In that instance, a lower turnout could create an advantage for Trump.\n\n\"This seems to be their strategy, disgust everyone with our democratic dialogue so that they won't come out to the polls,\" John Podesta, Clinton's campaign chairman, told reporters Tuesday. \"I think it is very unbecoming a presidential candidate.\"\n\nClinton said as much herself during an interview with a Florida radio station Tuesday.\n\n\"Despite all of the terrible things (Trump) has said and done, he is still trying to win this election,\" she said. \"And we cannot be complacent, we cannot rest.\"", "231": "Photos Credits: Social Media The so called \u201c opposition health authorities \u201d said in a statement posted online in Arabic: \n\u201cPrimary investigations point to a limited security breach by vandals likely connected to the regime, which has been attempting to target the medical sector in Free Syria in order to spread chaos.\u201d The statement also added: \u201cThe Syrian interim government\u2019s health ministry has instructed a halt to the second round of the measles vaccination campaign, which began Monday September 15th \u2026 following several fatalities and injuries among children in vaccination centers in the Idlib countryside.\u201d Adnan Hazouri, the health minister in the Syrian opposition who held a conference (in the Arabic Language) said that he will resign if an investigation upheld allegations of negligence, as blood samples have been sent to Turkey for analysis.

Whenever cornered, the machine switches the narrative to Russian hacking of the DNC. Edward Snowden, who knows a thing or two about cyberwarfare, stresses there is no solid proof Russian intel hacked the Democratic/Clinton machine. And if they actually did it, the NSA would know. The fact the NSA is mum reveals this is no more than information war.\nPass the missile launchers, please Trump seems to have been more on the money when he insisted how Hillary will be outsmarted \u0096 as she already was in the past \u0096 when dealing with President Putin, who she has demonized as Hitler.\nI have shown how Hillary will be prevented from launching WWIII because her no-fly zone is already implemented in Syria by Russia. And the Pentagon \u0096 reflecting Dunford\u0092s comments - knows it, no matter how emphatically soon-to-be-unemployed Pentagon head Ash Carter threatens \u0093 consequences .\u0094\nThe Pentagon ranks Russia and China as the number one and two \u0093existential threats\u0094 to US national security, in that order. And the US government reserves for itself the privilege of a nuclear \u0093first-strike\u0094 \u0096 which Hillary supports (but not Trump); this is part of the 2002 Full Spectrum Dominance doctrine.\nThe relentless hysteria now crystallized as Cold War 2.0 has led scores of analysts to game the actual \u0096 terrifying - possibility of a US-Russia hot war. As much as the Cold War MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction) doctrine may now lie in the dust \u0096 exactly because Washington refuses to back down from \u0093first-strike\u0094 \u0096 only armchair Dr. Strangeloves get their kicks with the possibility of fighting a nuclear power. Dunford does not seem to be one of them.\nWhat Hillary Clinton will certainly do is to double down on proxy wars, Vietnam/Afghanistan-style. So expect a President Clinton to authorize full weaponization of those Beltway-loved \u0093moderate\u0094 Al-Qaeda-in-Syria rebels with plenty of shoulder-held missile launchers. This could easily get out of control \u0096 with lethal, yet not nuclear, consequences.\nThat\u0092s exactly the point made by Mikhail Rostovsky in Moscow daily Moskovsky Komsomolets; if Hillary ratchets up tensions, \u0093 things could get out of hand .\u0094\nAlso expect not so proxy ratcheting up of tension in the South China Sea; after all it was Hillary who claimed \u0091mothership\u0092 of the pivot to Asia; and it was Hillary who steered intra-South East Asian maritime disputes into the boiling cauldron of wider US-China competition.\nAnd if that was not hard boiled enough, US frustration will be at an all-time high after Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte\u0092s own pivot to China.\nSay hello to my new Sarmat A case can be made that official Moscow is carefully getting ready to work with a Clinton \u0096 as in Obama III \u0096 presidency, with Hillary, a devil they know well when she was Secretary of State, to be dealt with as a pragmatist, unwilling and unable to plunge US-Russia relations into total incandescence.\nA Clinton presidency for its part should know better than overestimate Russia\u0092s financial \u0093 weakness. \u0094\nThe national debt of Russia is only 17.7 percent of GDP; for the US it is a whopping 104.17 percent of GDP, or $19.2 trillion. Russia in 2015 had a trade surplus of $150 billion, while the US had a trade deficit of $531.5 billion. The current account surplus of Russia was 5.1 percent of GDP, or 65.8 billion, while the US ran a current account deficit of 484.1 billion, or 2.7 percent of GDP.\nBesides, Russia has all the natural resources it needs; unlike the US government, which believes it needs an empire of bases overseas and ten aircraft carrier task forces to secure the resources it lacks.\nMoreover, as much as the Pentagon may continue to be infested by neocon cells, sound generals are also able to identify key Russian signals \u0096 such as the unveiling of the RS-28 Sarmat nuclear missile, which NATO calls Satan 2.

Or is she?", "236": "Is It Time To Reconsider Lifetime Appointments To The Supreme Court?\n\nThe unexpected death of Justice Antonin Scalia and the looming face-off between the White House and the Senate over his replacement have revived proposals that would limit the tenure of U.S. Supreme Court justices.\n\nLegal scholars from both political parties renewed a call Tuesday to reconsider how much time justices spend on the high court. Many of them cited, with disapproval, a bruising and protracted clash building between President Obama and the GOP-controlled Senate over when and how to fill Scalia's vacancy.\n\n\"The point of life tenure is to keep justices insulated from politics,\" said George Washington University law professor Orin Kerr. \"That didn't quite pan out.\"\n\nFor years now, lawyers have been floating proposals that future high-court justices spend no more than 18 years at a time on the Supreme Court bench. The plan would space out appointments, so presidents would make appointments every two years, supporters said. That would bring regular turnover and fresh thinking to the court \u2014 and align with the longer life spans of Americans since the nation's founding, they argue.\n\n\"It just sounds undemocratic,\" said Gabe Roth, executive director of an advocacy group called Fix the Court, about the lifetime court appointments. \"There's definitely concern about the justices being out of touch. There have been a number of cases with modern technology, whether it be smartphones or bulk data collection or different types of ways of getting TV over the airwaves or over the Internet.\"\n\nThomas Merrill, a law professor at Columbia University and a former deputy U.S. solicitor general (1987-1990), said he's been \"a little bit skeptical\" of the idea of term limits for Supreme Court justices. But, Merrill said, his thinking has evolved.\n\n\"My current cautious endorsement of this is based on the perception that the whole issue of appointments to the Supreme Court has become incredibly contentious, partisan, political, almost to the point where the political system freezes up, as we're witnessing right now with the Scalia death,\" Merrill said. \"It would be a good thing not to have the type of Armageddon it looks like we're about to have.\"\n\nTerm-limit supporters point to a 2015 poll by Reuters/Ipsos, after high-profile rulings on Obama's health care legislation and same-sex marriage, that suggested two-thirds of respondents would support a 10-year limit on tenure on the Supreme Court.\n\nBut actually changing the system could be remarkably difficult for a political system that's already near paralysis. Some lawyers said the change could be made by lawmakers, but others have concluded it would require amending the Constitution. To do that, the House and Senate would need to vote their support, and then three-quarters of the states would have to approve. Another path would be for two-thirds of the states to call for a Constitutional Convention.\n\n\"Not likely, but possible,\" Kerr of George Washington University said. \"We'll see how this year goes. It may become unbearable with the president and the Senate duking it out every day.\"", "237": "Hillary Clinton has earned enough delegates to clinch the Democratic presidential nomination, according to an Associated Press count released Monday night \u2013 an assessment swiftly challenged by primary rival Bernie Sanders and his campaign.\n\nThe AP released its updated tally, showing the former secretary of state winning enough delegates to become the first woman to top a major party\u2019s presidential ticket, on the eve of the last major day of primary voting.\n\nThe AP said Clinton reached the 2,383 delegates needed to become the presumptive Democratic nominee with a weekend victory in Puerto Rico and late burst of support from superdelegates. Those are party officials and officeholders, many of them eager to wrap up the primary, free to support whichever candidate they want.\n\n\"We really need to bring a close to this primary process and get on to defeating Donald Trump,\" said Nancy Worley, a superdelegate who chairs Alabama's Democratic Party and provided one of the last endorsements to put Clinton over the top.\n\n\"It's time to stand behind our presumptive candidate,\" said Michael Brown, one of two superdelegates from the District of Columbia who came forward in the past week to back Clinton before the city's June 14 primary. \"We shouldn't be acting like we are undecided when the people of America have spoken.\"\n\n\n\nClinton touted the news at a Long Beach, Calif., campaign event, saying the campaign is now on the \u201cbrink of a historic \u2026 unprecedented moment.\u201d But even she stressed that six states are yet to vote on Tuesday and urged supporters to cast their ballots for her in those contests.\n\nThe six states to vote Tuesday include New Jersey, North Dakota, New Mexico, Montana, California, and South Dakota.\n\nCampaign manager Robby Mook said in a statement: \u201cThis is an important milestone, but there are six states that are voting Tuesday, with millions of people heading to the polls, and Hillary Clinton is working to earn every vote. We look forward to\u00a0Tuesday\u00a0night, when Hillary Clinton will clinch not only a win in the popular vote, but also the majority of pledged delegates.\"\n\nThe Sanders campaign rejected the declaration that Clinton had clinched the party nod, citing its longstanding position that the superdelegates should not count until they actually vote at the convention \u2013 as they are free to switch sides before then.\n\n\"There is nothing to concede,\" Sanders told KTVU late Monday at a rally in San Francisco. \"Secretary Clinton will not have the requisite number of pledged delegates to win the Democratic nomination. She will be dependent on superdelegates. They vote on July 25th so right now our goal right at this moment [is to] do everything we can to win the primary tomorrow.\"\n\nSanders spokesman Michael Briggs accused the media of \u201ca rush to judgement\" and \"ignoring the Democratic National Committee\u2019s clear statement that it is wrong to count the votes of superdelegates before they actually vote at the convention this summer.\"\n\n\"Our job from now until the convention is to convince those superdelegates that Bernie is by far the strongest candidate against Donald Trump,\" Briggs said.\n\nOn Monday, Sanders' supporters expressed disappointment that the calls were made before California's primary and urged the senator to continue on despite the pronouncements. \"We're going to keep fighting until the last vote is counted,\" said Kristen Elliott, a Sanders' supporter from San Francisco who attended the rally.\n\nSaid another attendee, Patrick Bryant of San Francisco: \"It's what bookies do. They call fights before they're over.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi endorsed Clinton during an interview on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d before her home state\u2019s primary.\n\n\"I'm a voter in California and I have voted for Hillary Clinton for president of the United States and proud to endorse her for that position,\" Pelosi said, though adding \"it's not over until it's over.\"\n\nClinton has won 1,812 pledged delegates in primaries and caucuses. She also has the support of 571 superdelegates, according to an Associated Press count. The AP surveyed all 714 superdelegates repeatedly in the past seven months, and only 95 remain publicly uncommitted.\n\nAll the superdelegates counted in Clinton's tally have unequivocally told the AP they will back her at the convention and not change their vote.\u00a0Since the start of the AP's survey in late 2015, no superdelegates have switched from supporting Clinton to backing Sanders.\n\nClinton\u2019s presumptive victory Monday came nearly eight years to the day after she conceded her first White House campaign to Barack Obama. Back then, she famously noted her inability to \"shatter that highest, hardest glass ceiling.\"\n\nCampaigning this time as the loyal successor to Obama, Clinton fended off a surprisingly strong challenge from Vermont Sen. Sanders. He mobilized millions with a fervently liberal message and his insurgent candidacy revealed a deep level of national frustration with politics-as-usual, even among Democrats who have controlled the White House since 2009.\n\nClinton outpaced Sanders in winning new superdelegate endorsements even after his string of primary and caucus wins in May. Following the results in Puerto Rico, it is no longer possible for Sanders to reach the 2,383 needed to win the nomination based on the remaining available pledged delegates and uncommitted superdelegates, according to the AP.\n\nClinton leads Sanders by more than 3 million cast votes, by 291 pledged delegates and by 523 superdelegates. She also won 29 caucuses and primaries compared to his 21 victories.\n\nEchoing the sentiments of California Gov. Jerry Brown, who overcame a decades-long rivalry with the Clinton family to endorse her last week, many superdelegates expressed a desire to close ranks around a nominee who could defeat Trump in November.\n\nBeyond winning over millions of Sanders supporters who vow to remain loyal to the self-described democratic socialist, Clinton faces challenges as she turns toward November, including criticism of her decision to use a private email server run from her New York home while serving as secretary of state. Her deep unpopularity among Republicans has pushed many leery of Trump to nevertheless embrace his campaign.\n\n\"This to me is about saving the country and preventing a third progressive, liberal term, which is what a Clinton presidency would do,\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told the AP last week after he finally endorsed Trump, weeks after the New Yorker clinched the GOP nomination.\n\nYet Clinton showed no signs of limping into the general election as she approached the milestone, leaving Sanders behind and focusing on lacerating Trump. She said electing the billionaire businessman, who has spent months hitting her and her husband with bitingly personal attacks, would be a \"historic mistake.\"\n\n\"He is not just unprepared. He is temperamentally unfit to hold an office that requires knowledge, stability and immense responsibility,\" Clinton said last week in a speech that was striking in its forcefulness, previewing a brutal five-month general election campaign to come.\n\nEven without the nomination, Sanders can claim ideological victory. His liberal positions pushed the issue of income inequality into the spotlight and drove Clinton to the left on issues such as trade, Wall Street and campaign finance reform.\n\nBut she prevailed, in part, by claiming much of the coalition that boosted Obama. She won overwhelming support from women and minorities, catapulting her to decisive victories in diverse, delegate-rich states such as New York and Texas.\n\nWhen Clinton launched her campaign last April, she did so largely unopposed, having scared off more formidable challengers by locking down much of the party's organizational and fundraising infrastructure. Vice President Joe Biden, seen as her most threatening rival, opted not to run in October.\n\nOf the four opponents who did take her on, Sanders was the only one who emerged to provide a serious challenge. He caught fire among young voters and independents, his campaign gaining momentum from a narrow loss in Iowa in February and a commanding victory in New Hampshire. His ability to raise vast sums of money online gave him the resources to continue into the spring.\n\nBut Clinton vowed not to repeat the failings of her 2008 campaign and focused early on winning delegates, hiring help from Obama's old team before launching her campaign. They pushed superdelegates into making early commitments and held campaign appearances in areas where they could win the most pledged delegates.\n\nHer victory in Nevada in late February diminished concerns from allies about her campaign operation. Decisive wins in Southern states on Super Tuesday and a sweep of March 15 contests gave her a significant delegate lead, which became insurmountable by the end of April after big victories in New York and in the Northeast.\n\nShe now moves on to face Trump, whose ascent to the top of the Republican Party few expected. The brash real estate mogul and reality TV star has long since turned his attention from primary foes to Clinton, debuting a nickname \u2014 \"Crooked Hillary\" \u2014 and arguing she belongs in jail for her email setup.\n\nAfter a long primary campaign, Clinton said this past weekend in California she was ready to accept his challenge.\n\n\"We're judged by our words and our deeds, not our race, not our ethnicity, not our religion,\" she said Saturday in Oxnard. \"So it is time to judge Donald Trump by his words and his deeds. And I believe that his words and his deeds disqualify him from being president of the United States.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "238": "Hillary Clinton can\u2019t believe she\u2019s losing.

He cast his remarks as a bid to put the issue to rest once and for all, at a time when his poll numbers are rising.\n\n\u201cHillary Clinton and her campaign of 2008 started the birther controversy. I finished it,\u201d Trump said in Washington, D.C. \u201cPresident Barack Obama was born in the United States, period.

He briefly addressed the \u201cbirther\u201d issue at the end.\n\nThe statement comes after Trump\u2019s response on the matter in an interview Wednesday revived the issue. In the interview with\u00a0The Washington Post, Trump was asked whether he believed Obama was born in the U.S. \"I'll answer that question at the right time,\" Trump told the paper. \"I just don't want to answer it yet.\"\n\nTrump\u2019s campaign spokesman, trying to calm the waters, said overnight the Republican candidate now believes Obama was born in the U.S. Campaign spokesman Jason Miller said Trump \"did a great service to the country\" by bringing closure to the debate.\n\n\"In 2011, Mr. Trump was finally able to bring this ugly incident to its conclusion by successfully compelling President Obama to release his birth certificate,\" Miller said.\n\nBut the Clinton campaign seized on Trump\u2019s reluctance to address the issue in his Post interview.\n\nSpeaking shortly before Trump across town at the Black Women's Agenda Symposium, Clinton said Friday the Republican nominee was \u201cfeeding into\u201d the \u201cbigotry and bias that lurks in our country\u201d \u2013 and should apologize.\n\n\u201cBarack Obama was born in America,\u201d she said. \u201cDonald Trump owes him and the American people an apology.\u201d\n\nHer campaign called his Friday comments \"disgraceful.\"\n\nThe dust-up comes as Trump gains on Clinton in national and battleground state polls, even surpassing her in some states.\n\nA new Fox News poll shows Clinton topping Trump by just one point among likely voters in the four-way ballot nationally.\n\nIn the head-to-head matchup, Trump\u2019s up by one point.\n\nBoth candidates were fundraising Friday after events in Washington. Clinton has endured a rough week on the campaign trail, after criticizing some Trump supporters last Friday as \"deplorables\" and then having to take time off from the campaign due to a bout of pnemonia.\n\nShe used the birther issue to try and go back on offense.\n\nWhile Obama was born in Hawaii, Trump several years ago was a key figure in stoking the so-called \"birther\" controversy. Critics saw it as an attempt to delegitimize the nation\u2019s first black president.\n\nTrump has said repeatedly during the campaign that he no longer talks about the \"birther\" issue.\n\nThe Trump campaign\u2019s statement late Thursday claimed that Clinton launched the \u201cbirther\u201d movement during her unsuccessful primary run against Obama in 2008.\n\n\"Hillary Clinton's campaign first raised this issue to smear then-candidate Barack Obama in her very nasty, failed 2008 campaign for President,\" the statement said. \"This type of vicious and conniving behavior is straight from the Clinton Playbook. As usual, however, Hillary Clinton was too weak to get an answer.\"\n\nClinton has long denied the claim, and fact-checkers previously have found no public evidence that she or her campaign directly pushed the issue. Rather, Trump\u2019s comments appear to refer to reports that Clinton supporters circulated an email during the bitter 2008 primary race questioning Obama\u2019s citizenship.\n\nYet former McClatchy D.C. bureau chief James Asher said on Twitter Friday that Clinton confidant Sidney Blumenthal in fact \u201ctold me in person\u201d that Obama was born in Kenya.\n\nObama had released a standard short form of his birth certificate before the 2008 presidential election. Anyone who wants a copy of the more detailed, long-form document must submit a waiver request, and have that request approved by Hawaii's health department.\n\nIn 2011, amid persistent questions from Trump about his birthplace, Obama submitted a waiver request. He dispatched his personal lawyer to Hawaii to pick up copies and carry the documents back to Washington on a plane.\n\nThe form said Obama was born at 7:24 p.m. on Aug. 4, 1961, at Kapiolani Maternity and Gynecological Hospital in Honolulu. It is signed by the delivery doctor, Obama's mother and the local registrar.\n\nAt the White House on Friday, Obama declined to comment at length on the issue, saying he\u2019s got other business to attend to \u2013 and is confident about where he was born.\n\nFox News\u2019 Nicholas Kalman and Tamara Gitt and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "240": "(CNN) If confirmed to be from missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370, could a small portion of plane wing discovered on an Indian Ocean island be the clue investigators need to unlock one of aviation's biggest mysteries?\n\nOn the surface, the discovery on a Reunion Island beach is just what investigators have been waiting for -- the first physical piece of evidence since the flight vanished en route to Beijing in March 2014 with 239 people aboard.\n\nAccording to a source close to the investigation, Boeing investigators are confident the debris comes from a 777 aircraft -- although no one is yet saying the part came from Malaysia Airlines Flight 370.\n\n\"It's only a very small part of the aircraft, but it could be a very important piece of evidence,\" Australian Deputy Prime Minister Warren Truss said Friday\n\nBecause Reunion Island is a French territory, the debris has been flown to France, where aviation safety bureau the BEA has taken responsibility for its testing and analysis.\n\nThe flaperon arrived in Toulouse over the weekend, but the fact that so many different countries and groups are involved in the search for the missing flight has complicated and delayed the situation somewhat.\n\nAviation experts are not expected to begin examining the part until Wednesday, and it is unclear how long their analysis will take.\n\nTeams from each of the nations taking part in the search are expected to attend. Malaysia Airlines is sending investigators to France and a second team to Reunion, an airline official said.\n\nMary Schiavo, a CNN aviation analyst and former inspector general of the U.S. Department of Transportation, said those involved would be careful to make sure all tests were carried out scientifically, and completely by the book.\n\nShe said that while \"everyone knows that it most likely is from MH370,\" investigators do not want to jump to conclusions.\n\n\"They're going to do a lot of analysis on the part, everything from X-rays to sonograms,\" Schiavo said. \"Then when they finally cut it open (looking for serial numbers and part numbers), it has to be filmed, all the parties to the investigation -- there are seven nations in this investigation -- they all need to be present.\"\n\nDavid Gallo, of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, agreed: \"That's the way the BEA -- the French version of the NTSB -- works; they will be very careful about what they say and don't say.\n\n\"It's going to be scientific. It's a piece of evidence in a criminal investigation at this point, so they're going to take it apart bit by bit.\"\n\nPlanes are stamped with serial numbers to allow parts to be identified and matched to a specific model and aircraft.\n\nA source close to the investigation said Boeing investigators feel confident the piece comes from a 777, based on photos that have been analyzed, and a stenciled number that corresponds to a 777 component.\n\nAnother source told CNN's Rene Marsh that Boeing engineers have seen a part number in photos. A parts supplier confirmed 10-60754-1133 is a part number on a seal associated with 777s.\n\nImages of the debris also appear to match schematic drawings for the right-wing flaperon from a Boeing 777. A flaperon helps the pilot control the aircraft.\n\n\"If the part numbers that are stamped on the pieces of the plane still survive, it literally could be a phone call to Boeing or the parts indices to see if it belongs to a 777. And if it belongs to a 777, it is MH370,\" said Schiavo.\n\nOf the five accidents involving Boeing 777s, MH370 is the only one in which debris hasn't been recovered, Schiavo said.\n\nIf the identifying numbers are missing, more tests will need to be conducted on the part to determine its origin.\n\nA French laboratory that the BEA could use has the capacity to \"identify very quickly\" which plane the debris belongs to, and what happened to it, a source close to the French investigation said.\n\nAustralian investigators, heavily involved for some time in the search, said they are looking at the barnacles attached to the discovered part that could allow marine biologists to tell how long it has been floating.\n\nTruss said that he understood \"the photographs that are available are of such detail that it may be possible to make an identification without further physical examination.\"\n\nWhat does the condition of the debris indicate?\n\nThrough the French laboratory near Toulouse, \"engineers would be able to identify quickly whether the plane exploded in the air or whether it broke when hitting the water,\" the source close to the French investigation said.\n\nImages of the component appear to show a small amount of damage to the front of the flaperon and a ragged horizontal tear across the back.\n\nOne group of independent observers has said that the damage to the flaperon should give authorities a good indication that the piece came off while the plane was still in the air.\n\nThe rear damage could have been caused if the airliner had its flaperon down as it went into the ocean, some members of the group, led by American Mobile Satellite Corp. co-founder Mike Exner, wrote in a preliminary assessment.\n\nBut the lack of damage to the front makes it more likely the plane was in a high-speed, steep, spiral descent and the part fluttered until it broke off, the group said.\n\nIf the flaperon were still on the wing when the plane hit water, the front would have been damaged by hitting the part of the wing to which it was attached, the group says.\n\nHowever, Tom Ballantyne of Orient Aviation magazine said the condition of debris could indicate if the plane met a catastrophic end. Charring, for example, could indicate an explosion, he said.\n\nSciavo said investigators would be on the look out for tell-tale signs of what caused the crash: \"It's possible to find positive evidence of a criminal act, or, of course they could find the absence of that.\n\n\"If they find characteristic pitting in the wing structure, in the metal or the composite, that indicates there was some sort of explosive device, or if they find residue, which is not likely (after) this long in he ocean,\" she said.\n\n\"But they'll probably not be able to tell why the plane went down -- only that it did, and the manner in which it did.\"\n\nTo learn more, the flight data recorders -- or so-called black boxes -- will be crucial.\n\nIf it is from MH370, will the main search area move?\n\nTruss told a press conference Friday that the discovery of the debris in Reunion was \"consistent with some of the modeling we've done.\"\n\n\"We remain confident that we're searching in the right place,\" he said.\n\nHe said authorities would \"continue to concentrate our efforts on seeking to locate the aircraft in the identified area.\"\n\nThe current search is focused deep in the ocean off Western Australia, along an arc considered by investigators to be the most likely area the plane went down if it turned back toward Malaysia, as indicated by data, and stayed in the air before running out of fuel.\n\nThe southern end of the search area was the main focus, Truss said, but during the winter months weather conditions at that latitude were poor.\n\nOnce that search was completed, he said, searchers would focus efforts on a second identified area of interest.\n\nIf it's part of the plane, is it more likely the main section will be found?\n\nTruss said that if the flaperon is proven to be from MH370, its discovery did not \"provide a great deal of help in specifically identifying where the aircraft is.\"\n\nIf confirmed, however, the find is likely to give investigators further belief that other pieces of the plane have been carried by currents to the same region.\n\nWill debris lead to a rethinking of past theories?\n\nThomas said, if anything, the location of the potential debris confirms modeling from the University of Western Australia that showed material from the plane could wash up around Reunion between 12 to 24 months after the plane's disappearance.\n\nDespite the modeling, no one had been searching in that area, he said, because of the vast nature of the Indian Ocean and the multitude of factors that meant finding anything would be matter of luck and time.\n\n\"It was a matter of waiting for something to wash up,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Truss said, a positive identification with MH370 would rule out the some of the more left-field theories that the aircraft was \"secretly parked in some hidden place\" on land.", "241": "GOOGLE PLANNED MASSIVE AI INTEGRATED SOCIAL NETWORK SPY TOOL FOR HILLARY CAMPAIGN IN 2014   Source: Higgins News Network \nA newly released Podesta email reveals that Google CEO Eric Schmidt contacted the Hillary campaign in 2014 to begin their partnership in sponsoring Clinton\u2019s campaign run for President in 2016. \nThe revelations come from a memo in the email sent to Cherry Mills which was then forwarded Robby Mook, John Podesta, and David Plouffe. \nSchmidt\u2019s memo outlines an overall campaign strategy for Hillary, Schmidt\u2019s vision for a massive cloud-based AI integrate software program and also reveals that Google colluded with the Obama administration in the 2012 election. \nThe memo goes on to layout plans to construct a massive cloud-based database, along with programs that leveraged machine learning (aka Artificial Intelligence) that would be used to first to track users online to create a partial digital voter ids. \nThose partial digital ids contain a collection of attributes about the users online behavior which Schmidt explains will all eventually be tied to a real voter id file by leveraging machine learning. \nSchmidt details the procurement of a development team and the use of outline money to create software that will be connected to users smart phones on 2016 that would allow volunteers the ability to access any and all voter data. \nSchmidt also outlines ideas for the using the integrated tool to monitor social media and news stories to help promote positive articles and target the source of \u201crumors\u201d and negative articles. \nGiven Google\u2019s massive collection of personal user data combined with previous revelations that Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerburg and Facebook COO were colluding with Hillary raises series concerns above user privacy, media manipulation and host of other problems. \nThat combined with the fact that just about every other Silicon Valley company and executive is behind the Hillary Campaign makes this a chilling memo that should be getting much more attention than it is.

campaign ideas and I havescheduled some meetings in the next few weeks for veterans of the campaign to tell me how to make these ideas better. This is simply a draft but dolet me know if this is a helpful process for you all. Thanks !! Eric \n\nNotes for a 2016 Democratic CampaignEric Schmidt \nHere are some comments and observations based on what we saw in the 2012campaign. If we get started soon, we will be in a very strong position toexecute well for 2016. \n1. Size, Structure and Timing \nLets assume a total budget of about $1.5Billion, with more than 5000 paidemployees and million(s) of volunteers. The entire startup ceasesoperation four days after November 8, 2016 . The structure includes aChairman or Chairwoman who is the external face of the campaign and aPresident who is the executive in charge of objectives, measurements,systems and building and managing the organization. \nEvery day matters as our end date does not change. An official campaignright after midterm elections and a preparatory team assembled now is best. \n2. Location \nThe campaign headquarters will have about a thousand people, mostly youngand hardworking and enthusiastic. Its important to have a very largehiring pool (such as Chicago or NYC) from which to choose enthusiastic,smart and low paid permanent employees. DC is a poor choice as its full ofdistractions and interruptions. Moving the location from DC elsewhereguarantees visitors have taken the time to travel and to help. \nThe key is a large population of talented people who are dying to work foryou. Any outer borough of NYC, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Boston are all goodexamples of a large, blue state city to base in. \nEmployees will relocate to participate in the campaign, and will find lowcost temporary housing or live with campaign supporters on a donated basis.This worked well in Chicago and can work elsewhere. \nThe computers will be in the cloud and most likely on Amazon Web services(AWS) . All the campaign needs are portable computers, tablets and smartphones along with credit card reader s. \n3. The pieces of a Campaign \na) The Field \nIts important to have strong field leadership, with autonomy andempowerment. Operations talent needs to build the offices, set up thesystems, hire the people, and administer what is about 5000 people.Initial modeling will show heavy hiring in the key battleground states.There is plenty of time to set these functions up and build the humansystems. T he field is about organizing people, voter contact, and get outthe vote programs. \nFor organizing tools, build a simple way to link people and activities as aworkflow and let the field manage the system, all cloud based. Build asimple organizing tool with a functioning back-end. Avoid deep integrationas the benefits are not worth it. Build on the cloud. Organizing isreally about sharing and linking people, and this tool would measure andtrack all of it. \nThere are many other crucial early investments needed in the field:determining the precise list of battleground states, doing early polling toconfirm initial biases, and maintaining and extending voter protectionprograms at the state level. \nb) The Voter \nKey is the development of a single record for a voter that aggregates allthat is known about them. In 2016 smart phones will be used to identify,meet, and update profiles on the voter. A dynamic volunteer can easilyspeak with a voter and, with their email or other digital handle, get thevoter videos and other answers to areas they care about (\u201cthe benefits ofACA to you\u201d etc.) \nThe scenario includes a volunteer on a walk list, encountering a potentialvoter, updating the records real time and deepening contact with the voterand the information we have to offer. \nc) Digital \nA large group of campaign employees will use digital marketing methods toconnect to voters, to offer information, to use social networks to spreadgood news, and to raise money. Partners like Blue State Digital will domuch of the fund raising. A key point is to convert BSD and other partnersto pure cloud service offerings to handle the expected crush and load. \nd) Media (paid), (earned) and (social), and polling \nNew tools should be developed to measure reach and impact of paid, earnedand social media. The impact of press coverage should be measurable inreach and impact, and TV effectiveness measured by attention and othersurveys. \nBuild tools that measure the rate and spread of stories and rumors , andmodel how it works and who has the biggest impact. Tools can tell us aboutthe origin of stories and the impact of any venue, person or theme .Connect polling into this in some way. \nFind a way to do polling online and not on phones. \ne) Analytics and data science and modeling, polling and resourceoptimization tools \nFor each voter, a score is computed ranking probability of the right vote.Analytics can model demographics, social factors and many other attributesof the needed voters. Modeling will tell us what who we need to turn outand why, and studies of effectiveness will let us know what approaches workwell. Machine intelligence across the data should identify the mostimportant factors for turnout, and preference. \nIt should be possible to link the voter records in Van with upcomingdatabases from companies like Comcast and others for media measurementpurposes. \nThe analytics tools can be built in house or partnered with a set ofvendors. \nf) Core engineering, voter database and contact with voters online \nThe database of voters (NGP Van) is a fine starting point for voter recordsand i s maintained by the vendor (and needs to be converted to the cloud ).The code developed for 2012 (Narwahl etc. ) is unlikely to be used, andreplaced by a model where the vendor data is kept in the Van database andintermediate databases are arranged with additional information for a voter. \nQuite a bit of software is to be developed to match digital identities withthe actual voter file with high confidence . The key unit of the campaignis a \u201cvoter\u201d, and each and every record is viewable and updatable byvolunteers in search of more accurate information . \nIn the case w here we can\u2019t identify the specific human , we can still have a partial digital voter id , for a person or \u201cprobable-person\u201d with attributesthat we can identify and use to targe t. As they respond we can eventuallymatch to a registered voter in the main file. This digital key iseventually matched to a real person . \nThe Rules \nIts important that all the player in the campaign work at cost and there beno special interests in the financing structure . This means that allvendors work at cost and there is a separate auditing function to ensure noone is profiting unfairly from the campaign. All investments and conflictsof interest would have to be publicly disclosed. The rules of the auditshould include caps on individual salaries and no investor profits from thecampaign function. (For example, this rule would apply to me.) \nThe KEY things \na) early b uild of an integrated development team and recognition that thisis an entire system that has to be managed as suchb) decisions to exclusively use cloud solutions for scalability, and choiceof vendors and any software from 2012 that will be reused.c) the role of the smart phone in the hands of a volunteer. The smartphone manages the process, updates the database, informs the citizen, andallows fundraising and recruitment of volunteers (on android and iphone).d) early and continued focus of qualifying fundraising dollars to build thefield, and build all the tools. Outside money will be plentiful andperfect for TV use. A smart media mix tool tells all we need to know aboutmedia placement, TV versus other media and digital media .  ", "242": "The\u00a0Wall Street Journal's Adam Entous dropped a huge story Tuesday morning: Israel acquired classified US information while spying on the Iranian nuclear negotiations, and leaked the stolen information about the emerging deal to American lawmakers in an attempt to sabotage the Obama administration's outreach to Tehran.\n\nThis is\u00a0yet another disaster for US-Israel relations. But that's not because Israel acquired classified US information, which honestly isn't that surprising. What's really outrageous is that Israel used the information in a deliberate attempt to manipulate American politics.\n\nNo one should be shocked that Israel was spying on the talks. A certain degree of espionage is pretty par for the course in world politics, even among allies. Indeed, as Entous' story repeatedly makes clear, American officials expected Israel to snoop on them. In fact, according to Entous, the US found out about the Israeli spying because it was already spying on Israel:\n\nBut there is a real scandal here, and that's Israel using stolen intelligence as part of a deliberate campaign of messing around with American partisan politics. That's why the White House is angry: \"It is one thing for the U.S. and Israel to spy on each other. It is another thing for Israel to steal U.S. secrets and play them back to U.S. legislators to undermine U.S. diplomacy,\" a senior US official told Entous.\n\nIf Entous' reporting is correct, the Israeli government used the leaked information to help Republicans build support for new sanctions among Democrats, which would be necessary to overcome Obama's veto.\u00a0Israel was using stolen information to help Mitch McConnell and John Boehner foment a Democratic rebellion against the president.\n\nThis is the same reason\u00a0Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress about Iran infuriated so many Democrats this month. The problem wasn't that Netanyahu was invited to Congress; it's that the speech was coordinated with Republicans behind the president's back in a deliberate attempt to undermine his Iran policy.\n\n\n\nThe spying/briefing allegations suggest the speech was part of a much broader campaign to help Republicans pass new sanctions, a particularly dangerous move by Netanyahu at a time when Israel is\u00a0at risk of becoming a partisan issue in America.\n\nAllies really aren't supposed to do this sort of thing. Playing partisan domestic politics \u2014 and doing it with classified information, no less \u2014 positions Israel as the Republican Party's ally, not America's.\u00a0The fact that Republican interests line up with Israel's in this case doesn't justify crossing these lines.\n\nNone of this is to say the Netanyahu government has to just sit down and accept an American Iran policy it opposes. It's perfectly within bounds for Netanyahu to publicly oppose the ongoing negotiations in which international powers are seeking to limit Iran's nuclear capabilities in exchange for relief on its crippling economic sanctions. It's fine for Netanyahu to lobby the French, who have\u00a0an important role in the negotiations, to push for more stringent limits on Iran's nuclear program. That's all normal international politics.", "243": "The United States comes up constantly when you talk to Russians about their country's place in the world. But the conversations tend to go a lot differently than many Americans might expect.\n\nIn the US, the common view is that Russians feel aggrieved by the loss of the Soviet Union and all the respect that came with being a global superpower. Russia's acts of aggression in Europe, in this telling, are all about challenging the American-led order as a way to prove Russia's might and importance. This aggression is wildly popular among Russians, many Americans believe, because it makes them feel patriotic and powerful to bully the West, and particularly the US, which they blame for Russia's problems.\n\n\"Russia took off its ideological blinders in 1991, but America still seems to have them on\"\n\nThere is certainly truth to this, but it's just a piece of the truth. Rather, when you speak to influential people across institutions and the political spectrum in Russia, as Amanda Taub and I did during a recent reporting trip there, the story you hear over and over is one of Russia's fundamental weakness. And you hear a preoccupation with the United States that goes far beyond what even many Americans, who are famously narcissistic about our country, would expect.\n\nIn this telling, Moscow capitulated at the end of the Cold War, and even tried to make itself a friend to the far more powerful United States. But an irrationally aggressive America has instead sought repeatedly to weaken, control, or even destroy Russia. Their country, in this view, is insecure against an overwhelmingly powerful West. Its actions that we see as aggressive are actually defensive. And Moscow is kept safe only by careful vigilance and by the nuclear arsenal that you hear Russians cite over and over.\n\nThis is the version of history you hear in Russia from detached foreign policy pragmatists, from pro-Putin ideologues and anti-Putin ideologues, even from members of the pro-Western political opposition who support what they believe be to a Western agenda of weakening Russia.\n\nThere's a quote that speaks perfectly to this Russian worldview \u2014 and how Americans misunderstand it \u2014 in the most recent issue of Russia in Global Affairs, a Russian foreign policy journal that is widely considered to reflect the views of Russia's foreign policy establishment. The quote is from a Q&A with Vladimir Lukin, a prominent Russian diplomat and liberal politician who previously served as ambassador to the US:\n\nInterviewer: In his 1994 book \"Diplomacy,\" Henry Kissinger writes that \"integrating Russia into the international system is a key task\" for the United States. But as he was saying this, the Americans were actually pushing Moscow away with their policy. Why? Vladimir Lukin: It is in the genes. America has a simple ideology \u2013 that there is only one truth in the world, that truth is held by God, and God created the United States to be an embodiment of that truth. So the Americans strive to bring this truth to the rest of the world and to make it happy. Only after that will everything be well. This ideology has a strong influence on their policy. A wise traditionalist and a geopolitical expert, Kissinger had good reason to call such politicians \"Trotskyites\" for advocating a world revolution, albeit in their own way, but always in the front and in shining armor. This is a tempting ideology and has been professed by different countries at different times, not only the United States.\n\nLukin is hardly seen as an anti-American hard-liner in Russia \u2014 rather, he's considered to be an objective expert on the United States and a highly professional diplomat. He is a founding member of the liberal opposition party Yabloko. That he would get the United States so obviously wrong \u2014 what Americans would call defending democracy and human rights, he sees as a far more radical and explicitly religious agenda of \"advocating a world revolution\" \u2014 is troubling. But his view is a common one, and that tells you a great deal.\n\nThe interviewer's response is similarly telling: \"So Russia took off its ideological blinders in 1991, but America still seems to have them on. The Soviet Union is gone, but the policy against it is not.\"\n\nThis narrative of an inherently aggressive America is one we heard over and over in Moscow, not just from people who support Russian President Vladimir Putin and his aggressive, anti-American policies but even from those who oppose them. In this view, American politics and policies are bent on, and in many ways driven by, a hatred of Russia and desire to destroy or at least control it. Russia has had no choice but to meet American aggression with defensive actions such as putting nuclear-capable missiles in Europe or arming eastern Ukrainian militias at threat of genocidal extermination by American-backed fascists, if only to deter the US from further actions that could lead to all-out war.\n\nIt's not hard to poke holes in this Russian worldview. As Stephen Sestanovich, a longtime senior State Department official who helped engineer the Clinton administration's Russia policies, wrote in a recent article for the American Interest,\u00a0even the \"pragmatic\" Russian case for annexing Crimea in March 2014 makes little strategic sense:\n\nYet this was the worldview we heard even from professionals and politicians in Russia who oppose anti-Western policies. One foreign policy expert who wished for rapprochement with the West sighed to us that it would be impossible because Hillary Clinton, whom he said was widely viewed as irrationally anti-Russian, would soon take office. At another meeting, a political opposition leader remarked offhand that he hoped the US would be successful in its efforts to engineer regime change in Moscow.\n\nAs Sestanovich writes in his essay, \"The idea that the United States aims at a 'color revolution' in Moscow is the single most frequently repeated theme of official Russian rhetoric.\" This is more than paranoia or government propaganda; it is the accepted worldview: that Russia is under constant threat from a hostile and irrational United States.\n\nLukin, at another point in his Q&A, lamented that the US had rejected Moscow's gestures at cooperation in the 1990s and instead sought to surround Russia with a hostile NATO alliance, thus forcing Russia into a defensive crouch and creating today's tensions. \"It was the biggest mistake the West made,\" he said, \"and gradually led to the current situation.\"\n\nThese fears about America are likely to worsen in Russia if Hillary Clinton becomes president; many people told us she is seen by many Russians, especially Russian policymakers, as unbendingly hostile to Moscow and bent on the Putin government's destruction.\n\n\"Hillary is the worst option of any president,\" Fyodor Lukyanov, an influential Russian foreign policy expert who edits a leading foreign affairs journal and heads a foreign policy think tank, told us.\n\n\"Many people here believe that [she and her team] will try to come back to the line of the 1990s to encourage Russia into an internal transformation,\" Lukyanov added. \"Not by force, of course, but to encourage some kind of social development that will upend the current system and will promote a new one.\"\n\nWATCH: What most people miss about the war in the Ukraine", "244": "While Trump\u2019s edge is just 1 point \u2014 which is well within the margin of error \u2014 the Republican candidate has made up 13 points in under two weeks.\n\nTrump \u2014 who used to read off every poll he led during rallies but had\u00a0begun to call them inaccurate after he started to decline \u2014 has decided he likes them again, or at least he likes this one.\n\nBut not everyone wants to capitalize on the poll. Former House speaker Newt Gingrich called the new poll an \u201cabsurdity.\u201d\n\nAt this point in 2012, Mitt Romney led President Obama by 1 point.\n\nThe daily tracking poll was\u00a0conducted\u00a0Oct. 27-30, 2016, and included 1,128 likely voters. The margin of error is\u00a03 points.", "245": "The chaotic scene -- accompanied by loud chants of \"shame, shame, shame\" -- included one Democrat facing off with the second-highest-ranking House Republican, accusations of foul play and a series of insults being traded openly on the House floor.\n\nThe clash began over a yearly spending bill to fund military construction projects and the Veterans Administration. Because the bill covers spending on federal contracts, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-New York, attached what he said was a one-sentence proposal to uphold President Barack Obama's executive order protecting LGBT workers from being fired. The amendment had enough votes to pass but the vote was held open, and several Republicans changed their position just before the vote was officially closed.\n\n\"They literally snatched discrimination out of the jaws of equality. We won this vote,\" a visibly irate Maloney told reporters.\n\nMaloney accused House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of \"twisting arms.\" Maloney and other Democrats told CNN that once the vote board showed the measure had 217 votes -- enough to pass with just eight seconds left in the vote -- McCarthy personally approached House GOP members to switch their \"yes\" votes to \"no\" as the presiding officer kept the vote open for several minutes past the standard five-minute period.\n\nA senior House Republican leadership aide told CNN that it wasn't just McCarthy -- all the top GOP leaders were working to defeat Maloney's amendment because they were concerned that if passed, it would jeopardize the spending bill. When Maloney walked over to McCarthy to appeal to him to allow the measure to pass, saying plenty of Republicans backed it, he said McCarthy told him \"get on my own side of the aisle.\" He answered back to the majority leader, \"What side am I supposed to stand on to support equality?\" One Republican who witnessed the exchange said Maloney walked over to the GOP side of the chamber and was \"taunting Republican members\" and had his arms up in the air as he was trying to talk to them about letting his proposal pass. Roughly a dozen Republicans approached Maloney as the vote was extended and told him they disagreed with their own leadership's tactics to work to defeat the measure. California Democratic Rep. Mark Takano, who was standing with Maloney, told reporters that Illinois GOP Rep. Bob Dold told the New York Democrat \"this is bulls***.\" As the scene unfolded, reporters outside the chamber could hear jeers as the gavel came down with a new 212-213 vote tally, defeating the measure. No. 2 House Democrat Steny Hoyer began shouting and calling out Republicans for not following the traditional practice of coming to the well of the House floor to change their votes, saying they instead remained in their seats to avoid being identified. Afterward, Democrats produced a list of seven House Republicans, including the head of the GOP's campaign arm, Oregon Republican Rep. Greg Walden, who initially backed Maloney's proposal before switching their votes. The other Republicans, according to a floor vote printout by Democratic staff, were Rep. Jeff Denham, R-California, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, Rep. Bruce Poliquin, R-Maine, Rep. David Valadao, R-California, Rep. Mimi Walters, R-California, and Rep. David Young, R-Iowa. Hoyer's staff also tweeted out the list of names, calling their votes \"shameful.\" CNN has reached out to all seven House Republicans who changed their vote Thursday morning. So far, only Poliquin has responded about why he decided to vote no for the measure after originally registering support for it, defending his vote in a written statement to CNN. \"I am outraged that political opponents or members of the press would claim or insinuate that I cast a vote due to pressure or party politics,\" Poliquin wrote. \"No one controls my vote. I work hard only for the people of Maine's 2nd Congressional District.\" Poliquin added, \"I abhor discrimination in any form and at any place.\" \"They are bigots, they are haters,\" a seething Democratic Rep. Steve Israel said about House Republicans. He then immediately worked to tie House Republicans to Donald Trump, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, saying Trump \"is very proud of House Republicans today.\" House Speaker Paul Ryan, who as the speaker doesn't typically vote, was holding his weekly news conference and missed the fracas. When asked about what happened, he told reporters he didn't have any details about who may have changed their votes, but made it clear he opposed the Democrats' proposal. \"The states should do this. The federal government shouldn't stick its nose in this business,\" Ryan said. Maloney vowed, \"These things are going to be remembered\" and told reporters he planned to try to push similar measures on other legislation. \"The people who stood in the schoolhouse door are going to have this hung around their necks for the rest of their careers, and I hope they can live with themselves,\" Maloney said. \"I hope they can look their kids in the eye and sleep OK tonight because what they did is as disgusting as one of the famous episodes in American history where we've seen people stand on the wrong side of the march toward Selma, or stand in the schoolhouse door when someone was trying to get an equal education.\"", "246": "Fluoridation of public water supplies as well as the abundance of fluoride in food and dental products have become more controversial in recent years as more and more people realize that the... ", "247": "(CNN) Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders both accused Donald Trump of inciting violence, with the former secretary of state calling him \"bigoted\" and alleging he had perpetrated \"political arson,\" while the Vermont senator labeled him a \"pathological liar\" at a town hall on Sunday night.\n\n\"It is clear that Donald Trump is running a very cynical campaign pitting groups of Americans against one another. He is trafficking in hate and fear,\" Clinton said during the event at Ohio State University hosted by CNN and TV One. \"He actually incites violence in the way he urges his audience on, talking about punching people, offering to pay legal bills.\"\n\nClinton charged that Trump was guilty of a case of \"political arson\" by throwing fuel on political divisions in the country.\n\n\"He has been incredibly bigoted towards so many groups,\" she continued. \"You don't make America great by tearing down everything that made America great.\"\n\nClinton followed Sanders at the town hall moderated by CNN's Jake Tapper and TV One's Roland Martin. Sanders and Clinton are making closing arguments to voters in their increasingly contentious Democratic nominating marathon, two days before five states vote in crucial primaries that could set the tone for the rest of the contest.\n\nOn Sunday night, Clinton's comments followed Sanders' own sharp criticism of Trump.\n\n\"I hesitate to say this because I really don't like to disparage public officials, but Donald Trump is a pathological liar,\" Sanders said.\n\nSanders also blasted Trump for saying that he might pay the legal fees of a man charged with punching a protester at one of his rallies, adding that doing so was tantamount to \"inciting violence.\"\n\n\"I would hope Mr. Trump tones it down big time and tells his supporters that violence is not acceptable in the American political process,\" Sanders said.\n\nIn one of the most dramatic moments of the night, Clinton was asked by audience member Ricky Jackson -- who spent 39 years in jail for a murder he did not commit, including a period on death row -- to justify her support for the death penalty in some cases.\n\nShe replied that the states had proven themselves incapable of carrying out fair trials and said she would \"breathe a sigh of relief\" if the Supreme Court and the states began to eliminate capital punishment.\n\nBut she argued that there was a case for a \"very limited use\" of the death penalty in cases of \"horrific\" terrorist crimes in federal cases like the bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City in 1995 during her husband's administration.\n\nSpeaking directly to Jackson, however, she told him, \"I just can't even imagine what you went through and how terrible those days and nights must have been for all those years. All of us are so regretful that you or any person had to go through what you did.\"\n\nJackson, who is an undecided voter, was then asked by Martin if he was satisfied with Clinton's response. He replied, \"Yes. Thank you very much. Thank you, senator.\"\n\nThe town hall took place in the wake of Sanders' surprise victory in the Michigan primary last week, which raised his hopes of competing with Clinton across Midwestern Rust Belt states.\n\nThey faced questions from Buckeye State voters as they vie for the support of blue collar and minority voters who underpin the Democratic coalition.\n\nIt also came at the end of a weekend filled with violence and disruption of Trump rallies, in which the real estate mogul pointed the finger at Sanders for the unruliness.\n\nBut Sanders said Sunday night, \"Our campaign does not believe and never will encourage anybody to disrupt anything.\"\n\nHe added that people have the right to protest even though he said other candidates' rallies shouldn't be disrupted.\n\n\"Trump has to get on the TV and tell his supporters that violence in the political process in America is not acceptable, end of discussion,\" he said.\n\nAt the same time, Sanders dismissed the idea that he was responsible for the actions of all his supporters.\n\n\"Millions of people voted for me. If I have to take responsibility for everybody who voted for me, it would be a very difficult life,\" Sanders said\n\nThe town hall was also an opportunity for the two Democratic candidates to highlight their differences even if they didn't meet face to face.\n\nOne questioner, Amit Majmudar, a radiologist born to Indian immigrant parents and Ohio's poet laureate, told each one that he had one mission at the ballot box, to keep Trump out of office and asked what each would do to defeat Trump.\n\nClinton argued that she was the best candidate to take on Trump because she was \"the only candidate who has gotten more votes than Trump\" in the 2016 contests held so far.\n\nShe added that she was building a broad-based campaign to convince people that this was the highest-stakes election they had ever been involved in, explicitly because Trump was likely to be the Republican nominee.\n\nAnd she said that the fact that Republicans had been \"after me\" for 25 years meant there wasn't anything the GOP had not already dug up about her.\n\n\"I am not new to the national arena and I think whoever goes up against Donald Trump better be ready,\" she said.\n\nClinton also said that there would be many arguments that Democrats could make against Trump but that she didn't want to \"spill the beans right now.\"\n\n\"I am having foreign leaders ask if they can endorse me to stop Donald Trump,\" Clinton said, though she declined to name any other than Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who she said had done so publicly.\n\nSanders, for his part, pivoted to his Democratic opponent on the issue of trade, which is emerging as a key theme on both sides of the aisle in the 2016 presidential race.\n\nHe lashed out at \"corporately written trade agreements,\" which he said were designed to shut down U.S factories and pay people \"pennies an hour\" in China and Mexico.\n\n\"One of the very strong differences between Secretary Clinton and myself -- she has supported almost all of those trade agreements, I have vigorously opposed (them),\" he charged.\n\nAt one point while talking about trade though, Sanders slipped in another backhanded slap at Trump. Defending his position on trade, Sanders said that he did not want to cut off the United States from global trade flows.\n\n\"Nobody is talking about building a wall around the United States,\" Sanders said, before trailing off when people in the audience started chuckling. \"Oh, I beg your pardon, there is one guy who is talking about building a wall. Let me rephrase it: no rational person is talking about building a wall.\"\n\nDuring Clinton's appearance, she sought to match her rival's rhetoric on trade after she was asked by a laid-off steel worker how she would deal with alleged dumping of steel in the U.S. market by foreign nations.\n\n\"I believe that the dumping is illegal and we have to summon up the political and the legal arguments to take it on,\" Clinton said, specifically accusing China of the practice. Other nations, including Italy, South Korea and India have in recent months been accused of dumping corrosion-resistant steel in the U.S. market.\n\nThe town hall segment with each candidate concluded with a few more personal questions.\n\nClinton was asked to elaborate on her recent comment that she's not a natural politician like her husband Bill Clinton or President Barack Obama.\n\nClinton turned the question into a way of stressing her particular skills while admitting her liabilities, saying she had worked hard to become a better politician but wanted to be more than just good at campaigning.\n\n\"I don't want to be hired to be a constant candidate, I want to be hired to be the president because I think that I, in this moment in our country's history, bring the combination of skills and understanding and experience that can be really put to work immediately to do all parts of the job,\" she said.\n\nShe also said that the campaign skills of her husband and Obama are \"poetry,\" relating that \"I get carried away and I have seen them a million times.\" She added that such stump skills were not her forte.\n\nSanders, asked which ideological opponents he got along with the best, mentioned Oklahoma Sen. James Inhofe, even though he's someone who Democrats have pilloried as a climate-change denier.\n\nThough Sanders has been scoring some points on trade, Clinton has so far built a more diverse constituency resting especially on African-American voters and Hispanics and appears to have the edge going into Tuesday's primaries in Ohio, Florida, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina.\n\nStill, Sanders has high hopes of good results in the Midwest in particular and has been driving his message that the economy is stacked against working Americans and underpinned by a corrupt political system.\n\nTuesday's primaries are hugely significant because they make up the third-highest allocation of delegates available on a single day in the Democratic presidential race.\n\nA new poll by The Wall Street Journal and NBC published on Sunday shows Clinton leading Sanders for the three biggest prizes available on Tuesday. She is up 61% to 34% on Sanders in Florida, leads him by 58% to 38% in Ohio and by six points in Illinois.\n\nSanders will be hoping that last Tuesday's results are an omen for this week after he went into the Michigan primary trailing badly in polls but still managed to best Clinton.\n\nThe former secretary of state, however, is looking to further bolster her lead in delegates over Sanders on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to CNN estimates, Clinton has 1,244 delegates (including 772 pledged delegates and 472 superdelegates). Sanders has 574 delegates (including 551 pledged delegates and 23 superdelegates). Superdelegates are party officials and lawmakers who can vote at the convention and have already made their intentions clear.\n\nCORRECTION: This story has been updated with the correct number of superdelegates for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.", "248": "Written by Ron Paul Sunday November 13, 2016 In a disturbing indication of how difficult it would be to bring military spending in line with actual threats overseas, House Armed Services Chairman Rep. Mac Thornberry (R \u2013 TX) told President Obama last week that his war funding request of $11.6 billion for the rest of the year was far too low. That figure for the last two months of 2016 is larger than Spain\u2019s budget for the entire year! And this is just a \u201cwar-fighting\u201d supplemental, not actual \u201cdefense\u201d spending! More US troops are being sent to Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, and elsewhere and the supplemental request is a way to pay for them without falling afoul of the \u201csequestration\u201d limits.The question is whether this increase in US military activity and spending overseas actually keeps us safer, or whether it simply keeps the deep state and the military-industrial complex alive and well-funded.Unfortunately many Americans confuse defense spending with military spending. The two terms are used almost interchangeably. But there is a huge difference. I have always said that I wouldn\u2019t cut anything from the defense budget. We need a robust defense of the United States and it would be foolish to believe that we have no enemies or potential enemies.The military budget is something very different from the defense budget. The military budget is the money spent each year not to defend the United States, but to enrich the military-industrial complex, benefit special interests, regime-change countries overseas, maintain a global US military empire, and provide defense to favored allies. The military budget for the United States is larger than the combined military spending budget of the next seven or so countries down the line.To get the military budget in line with our real defense needs would require a focus on our actual interests and a dramatic decrease in spending. The spending follows the policy, and the policy right now reflects the neocon and media propaganda that we must run the rest of the world or there will be total chaos. This is sometimes called \u201cAmerican exceptionalism,\u201d but it is far from a \u201cpro-American\u201d approach.Do we really need to continue spending hundreds of billions of dollars manipulating elections overseas? Destabilizing governments that do not do as Washington tells them? Rewarding those who follow Washington\u2019s orders with massive aid and weapons sales? Do we need to continue the endless war in Afghanistan even as we discover that Saudi Arabia had far more to do with 9/11 than the Taliban we have been fighting for a decade and a half? Do we really need 800 US military bases in more than 70 countries overseas? Do we need to continue to serve as the military protection force for our wealthy NATO partners even though they are more than capable of defending themselves? Do we need our CIA to continue to provoke revolutions like in Ukraine or armed insurgencies like in Syria?If the answer to these questions is \u201cyes,\u201d then I am afraid we should prepare for economic collapse in very short order. Then, with our economy in ruins, we will face the wrath of those countries overseas which have been in the crosshairs of our interventionist foreign policy. If the answer is no, then we must work to convince our countrymen to reject the idea of Empire and embrace the United States as a constitutional republic that no longer goes abroad seeking monsters to slay.

Clinton signed the court filing \"under penalty of perjury\" on October 10, one day after her debate with Republican nominee Donald Trump.\n\nClinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, have tangled with Judicial Watch for more than 20 years.\n\nSome of that friction showed in her answers over 20-odd pages, littered with objections. At times, the candidate accused the conservative nonprofit of misstating her earlier remarks.\n\nOn occasion, she declined to answer questions about the vulnerability of her emails to hacking on the ground that it exceeded the boundaries of what a judge ordered earlier this year. And she cited attorney-client privilege in refusing to answer a question about her 11-hour testimony to a congressional panel in October 2015 that 90 to 95 percent of her emails \"were in the State's system.\"\n\nThe Justice Department closed an investigation into Clinton's email practices with no charges against her or any of her aides. FBI Director James Comey found she had been \"extremely careless\" but concluded \"no reasonable prosecutor\" would have sought criminal charges. But that decision remains deeply unpopular among Republicans in Congress and with Trump, who is vying with Clinton to become president.\n\nIn the course of the investigation, the FBI recovered thousands of Clinton's emails during her tenure at the State Department. Many of those messages will be released in batches over the next month.\n\nClinton has said using one email account was a \"mistake\" she will not repeat. But it is also one she is unlikely to shake for the time being, if conservative watchdogs get their way.\n\n\"We're pleased that we now have a little bit more information about Hillary Clinton's email practices,\" Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said. \"Our lawyers will be reviewing the responses closely. Mrs. Clinton's refusal to answer many of the questions in a clear and straightforward manner further reflects disdain for the rule of law.\"", "250": "While Donald Trump doubled down this week on his vow to make Mexico pay for his proposed southern border wall, his campaign is reported to be weighing options that don\u2019t necessarily involve the seemingly far-fetched scenario of the Mexican government handing America a great, big check.\n\nLifeZette first reported that the Republican presidential nominee and his top advisers are looking at using assets seized from drug cartels and other traffickers. This reportedly could involve establishing a \u201cjoint border security fund\u201d -- holding seized assets from crackdowns on both sides of the border \u2013 for border construction and maintenance.\n\nTrump, asked Thursday by Fox News about the report, did not deny the option is on the table.\n\n\u201cThere are many ways that they can pay for the wall,\u201d Trump said, calling it a \u201cnegotiation.\u201d\n\nBut he again insisted, \u201cThe United States will not be paying for the wall. Mexico will be paying for the wall.\u201d\n\nBreitbart News, whose chairman Stephen Bannon left to be Trump\u2019s campaign CEO, also reported that cartel resources would be seized to fund the wall if Trump wins.\n\nTrump supporter, and former presidential primary rival, Ben Carson floated another option Thursday night.\n\nSpeaking with Fox News, Carson said money saved from enforcing the border could be used \u2013 though he did not elaborate on what level of savings the federal government could expect, particularly when Trump is proposing spending more money on border security resources.\n\n\u201cRecognize that a lot of money is going to be saved by enforcing our borders, by not, you know, giving various types of benefits to people who are here illegally,\u201d Carson said. \u201cThat money is money that we otherwise would not have had and that can be applied to the wall and various other things. That\u2019s I believe the spirit in which that comment is made. I don't think Mexico is going to write a check out and say here, pay for the wall.\u201d\n\nTrump has not addressed such details on the stump.\n\nHe declared in his immigration policy speech Wednesday night that, \u201cMexico will pay for the wall \u2026 they don\u2019t know it yet, but they\u2019re going to pay.\u201d\n\nThat came after Trump met with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto in Mexico City, and both men left the meeting battling over the payment issue. Trump said they didn\u2019t discuss \u201cpayment,\u201d while Pena Nieto said he made clear Mexico will not put up the money.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, Trump added the line about payment into his Phoenix speech, in response to Pena Nieto\u2019s claims.\n\nIf a Trump administration did pursue using cartel assets to fund a wall, it would take billions. Trump has estimated the wall could be built for as little as $8 billion, though other analyses have put the cost much higher.\n\nEstimates of Mexican cartel revenue vary drastically. The U.S. government estimated a decade ago that Mexican traffickers make nearly $14 billion on drug sales to the U.S.", "251": "Wed, 26 Oct 2016 18:19 UTC \u00a9 Jen Psaki President Obama holds news conference at the White House. As an American, someone raised to believe truth and justice will prevail, I am appalled at the foreign and domestic policies of my country's government. The level and scope of the deceit with which the Obama administration has laid out onto the world stage is embarrassing. For the first time in my 61 years I realize why some figures in our history were ashamed of being known as American. Our leaders have shamed us, done irreparable damage to our heritage and our legacy as a people, and still most of my countrymen sit idle. America today reminds me of a traveling circus, three rings of evil clowns entertaining a peanut gallery of onlookers. Or are we participant clowns? For over the better part of Barack Obama's presidency we've witnessed the most respected nation transformed, step-by-step, into one of the most dreaded empires the world has ever known. 300 million people, all their ancestors, and their future generations will pay the overwhelming cost of Obama's mistakes and malfeasance in office. While I do not personally believe this man is evil, I am sure the people behind him are. The lies, the impact, the unbelievable devastation these people have unwrapped, it spells the end of a perfect dream for humanity. I wonder as I type this, how many people reading it will realize how true my words are. John Kirby, the spokesperson for the US Department of State is a prototype for all that is wrong with our nation. He is a mirror reflection of Secretary of State John Kerry, who is in turn a further reflection of Barack Obama and the people who stand behind. They lie, cheat, steal, kill, maim, or at best coerce in order to achieve goals their constituency (the people) have no inkling of. All of us knew politicians have always been liars and crooked, but the degree to which we can be betrayed is unheard of today. This press conference on the alleged bombing of Aleppo hospitals by Russia, it is damning, damnable evidence of what I am saying. This is, of course, if one watches intently and then reasons. Compare what Kirby says, with what you have seen or read from the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times. Measure the tone and content of this unique message. Bear with me, and I'll help you convict these warmongers of their crimes. The Circus of Liars I must point out that Barack Obama has had more State Department spokespersons than any president in history. First there was Sean McCormack, from 2005 to 2009, a leftover from the Bush administration. After McCormack's tour of administration liar in chief, he joined Boeing in 2009 and serves as the as vice president of Communications in Government Operations. McCormack left the Obama administration to more or less help Hillary Clinton and the \"click\" extend the growth of companies like Boeing. This Washington Post piece (amazingly) condemns both Hillary Clinton and McCormack for their apparent collusion to morph policy into business with, guess who? Why Mother Russia, of course. Philip J. \"P.J.\" Crowley made his \"deal with the devil\" from 2009 to 2011. The 2011-2012 recipient of the General Omar N. Bradley Chair in Strategic Leadership (? The Military ties to State) is a War College bred and reared pentagon puppet. The fact most recent State Department liars are former military begs the question; \"Why is our foreign policy institution lined with CIA, spooks, War College graduates and command grade military officers?\" Crowley is an interesting example of how our foreign service is infested with war hawks and military industrial minions. To Crowley's credit, his candidness in the wake of the mistreatment of whistleblower Chelsea Manning, and his subsequent resignation redeemed this old soldier by comparison to his colleagues. He is emblematic of a system that uses good soldiers in order to mislead the people, and to misdirect our policies toward the wrong goals. Crowley is pretty much off the radar now, but somehow still semi-loyal to the Obama-Clinton team. His tweets on Twitter hum the Democratic Party line. He's now a Fellow at The George Washington University Institute for Public Diplomacy, which means he's been let out to pasture. Next we come to Victoria Jane Nuland, the pin-up girl of soulless and reprehensible US bureaucrats. From my perspective, as someone who has covered the Ukraine civil war extensively, Nuland in Kiev reminds me of the worst parts of the rise of Nazi Germany. I cannot possibly be bombastic enough in characterizing this Hillary Clinton spawn. It is not my nature to be unkind, or less than a gentleman, but this woman is no lady. Her hacked conversation, with fellow psychopath, US Ambassador to Ukraine Geoffrey Pyatt, lives in infamy amidst volumes of horrid US intentions. \"Fuck the EU\", along with the clear regime change the Obama White House was behind, should have spelled resignation for this demonic Washington witch. She, and her colleague Pyatt, are complicit in the deaths of thousands of innocent men, women and children in the Donbass. Nuland, who most agree will be Hillary Clinton's Secretary of State should she reach office, is the most deadly psychopath the American people could possibly put in charge of our foreign service. For the Russians who still have to deal with her, I am sure 20 minutes looking at her is unbearable. This is America fiddling, while our reputation abroad burns. She is the queen of regime change, she and her husband children of the ideology America needs to forcefully alter world governments. This is the \"WOW\" persona, the caricature of disastrous Washington policy. Don't take my word, research Nuland starting here , and see where it leads. Jen Psaki lied so well, and stuck up her nose to the dissenting press so expertly, she graduated the US State Department right up to the White House. Those of us who winced at her nonchalant misrepresentation of facts, also understand she is part of the click that now inhabits the halls of power in Washington. Psaki is part of a country club that runs it all. If the Democrats win in November's presidential election, people like Psaki will become monsters, an empowered American politburo kin to the worst fascists in history. Psaki is the official cheerleader now, of a White House campaign to create a legacy for the worst president in American history. Catch her Twitter feed her, and figure out why in the world Barack Obama would want to be a Wired Magazine editor for a day. Despite her pallid and docile appearance, make no mistake, this Obama minion is as deadly as Nuland, maybe even more so. I recall Psaki launched a social media attack on Russia that was nearly universally ridiculed as \"hash tag diplimacy.\" Her \"hot mic\" comment on her own points on Egypt at a press conference as being \"ridiculous\", they remind me of Obama being caught promising then Russian President Dmitry Medvedev he'd \"fix\" the ABM missiles issue if he won in 2012. What makes this spokesperson so dangerous is her forward enthusiasm, and her seeming happy-go-lucky satisfaction with being part of the biggest lie ever perpetrated. Lying is transfigured into truth, a job well worth doing. Good God. Finally we come to John Kirby, Naval War College trained mouthpiece for Emperor Caligula (look him up and compare to our presidents) and whichever Nero we elect next. A Public Affairs Officer (PAO) at the command level in the US Navy, he's what many former military people would refer to as a first class boot licker. I'm a squid myself, so I am familiar with the type. Kirby would climb a tree to tell a lie, if ordered to do so, and show righteousness in doing so. Kirby, Kerry, the whole Obama administration is utterly absurd. This recent press conference reveals just how out of bounds US policy is. Furthermore, Kirby's contention the Syrian war cannot end without airpower being grounded is likewise idiotic. The State Department's stance on Russia's hammering of jihadists only makes sense, if the overthrow of Assad and his legitimate government is a goal. John Kirby: Syrian War Won't End Without Grounding Aircraft - this is the headline that calls our attention to the fact Assad is about to wreck Washington's plan. Regime change has become such a common term now, that media consumers are immune to what it really means. Since the first Bush took office, since the fall of the Berlin Wall, more governments have been turned upside down than at any time since World War II. And the \"Kirbys\" of the world are accomplices to massive world chaos. Kirby's \"Russians in body bags\" threat has pushed the Kremlin's panic button now. We have descended into crisis policy, an all or nothing lunacy that can only end in war. Three Rings of Evil Clowns These people are all deplorable. But compared to the linchpins of war they speak for, each is insignificant by comparison. This message for instance, the New York Times headline \"U.S. Officials Say Russia Probably Attacked U.N. Humanitarian Convoy\", it did not originate with them. Our new \"probably\" dogma is a function of a failing freedom, the complete takeover of a free press by western oligarchs that make Russian mafia types seem impotent. Watching this evil circus reminds me of a twisted horror movie, a guttural glimpse at wicked clowns betraying the children they are supposed to love and entertain. The Soros and Rockefeller types, those Rotschilds and the Goldman Sachs sharks, Silicon Valley fakers and Wall Street urchins the Clintons take money off of, the whole mess in our nation's capital stinks to high heavens. Just how my countrymen stomach it leaves me breathless and clueless at times. America is taking part in a wider broadcast of the movie The Turman Show these days. Raised up to believe in freedom of the press and the merits of democracy, my countrymen have been conditioned to rely on their media, their leaders, and the seeming implausibility that one group can take over the world. Well, a group has taken over half of it, and with the proper time and funding, this can be proven. Since me or some other researcher has no such investigative grant, the case against these evil clowns goes untried. The Nation, Slate, Global Research, RT, and myriad independent media attempt to dissent. But trillions of dollars flow back and forth fueling the paranoiac message - Russia is the enemy again! The first ring of circus clowns wield more power than Xerxes, the Bilderbergs probably even believe their own cause - perpetuating the elite order is, after all, a noble genetic cause. In the second ring business types and the oh-so aggressive and ambitious, they will literally do anything to succeed. The Clintons, Bushs, and Obamas out there are the master puppets. Their mission is pretty clear, pay the devil his due and cash in. It's really as simple as all that. Today's Washington is a bit like Chicago during Capone's time. Once the \"Man\" has you, he's got you but good. La Cosa Nostra hasn't got anything on the numbers games along the Potomac. The little crime bosses, grown up from their internships and grant designations, they pepper every institution in America. As they graduate, God knows what goals the Kirbys of the world set out to achieve. In the wider center ring, it's easy to see the Clinton Foundation workers really do drink Bill and Hillary's Kool Aid. Mind washed into believing in the ultimate bullshit, na\u00efve middle intellectuals become squirming opportunists, oblivious to the fact they sold out. The \"Man\" has got them, and early on. Meanwhile, the whole mess is cloaked in the guise of democracy, and hidden underneath people's fear they'll be called conspiracy theorists. George Orwell's 1984 seems to have been written to exclude the possibility complete control could be achieved. But isn't that how complete control is ultimately achieved? Above the center ring, high up on the flying trapeze liberty defies death. The people are doing a high wire act without a net. We are the third ring of clowns, only we are hesitant to see our role as sellouts too. America is life under the big top, with our favorite pop stars handing out peanuts. I don't know how you feel about it, but I feel utterly betrayed.", "252": "When Donald Trump introduced his new university from the lobby of his famous tower, he declared that it would be unlike any of his other ventures.\n\nTrump University would be a noble endeavor, he said, with an emphasis on education over profits. It was a way for him to give back, to share his expertise with the masses, to build a \u201clegacy as an educator.\u201d\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t even keep all the money \u2014 if he happened to make a profit, he would turn the funds over to charity.\n\n\u201cIf I had a choice of making lots of money or imparting lots of knowledge, I think I\u2019d be as happy to impart knowledge as to make money,\u201d Trump said at the inaugural news conference in the spring of 2005.\n\nThe launch of Trump University coincided with two auspicious developments for the real estate mogul: Through his then-year-old hit TV show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the billionaire was developing an image as America\u2019s savviest boss, while the nation\u2019s booming real estate market was giving hope to many who dreamed of striking it rich.\n\nAds touted Trump University as \u201cthe next best thing to being Trump\u2019s apprentice.\u201d Trump, who every week on TV singled out someone to be fired, pledged in a promotional video to \u201chand-pick\u201d instructors. \u201cPriceless information\u201d would help attendees build wealth in the same real estate game that made Trump rich.\n\nIn the end, few if any of these statements would prove to be true.\n\nTrump University was not a university. It was not even a school. Rather, it was a series of seminars held in hotel ballrooms across the country that promised attendees they could get rich quick but were mostly devoted to enriching the people who ran them.\n\nParticipants were enticed with local newspaper ads featuring images of Trump, then encouraged to write checks or charge tens of thousands of dollars on credit cards for multi-day learning sessions. Participants were considered \u201cbuyers,\u201d as one internal document put it. According to the company\u2019s former president, Trump did not personally pick the instructors. Many attendees were trained by people with little or no real estate expertise, customers and former employees have alleged in lawsuits against the company.\n\n\u201cI was told to do one thing,\u201d said James Harris, a Trump University instructor whose sessions have been repeatedly cited in the litigation, in an interview with The Washington Post. \u201cAnd that one thing was: . . . to show up to teach, train and motivate people to purchase the Trump University products and services and make sure everybody bought. That is it.\u201d\n\nA Trump spokesman said Harris\u2019s comments \u201chave no merit\u201d and accused Harris of \u201clooking for media attention to further his own agenda.\u201d\n\nAll told, Trump University received about $40\u00a0million in revenue from more than 5,000 participants before it halted operations in 2010 amid lawsuits in New York and California alleging widespread fraud. The New York attorney general estimated Trump netted more than $5\u00a0million during the five\u00a0years it was active. He has since acknowledged that he gave none of the profits to charity.\n\nThis account is based on a review of hundreds of pages of internal company records that have become public as a result of the lawsuits, as well as new interviews with former Trump University employees and customers.\n\nMany of the company\u2019s internal records, including several \u201cplaybooks\u201d that advised employees on strategies for pressuring customers, were unsealed in court over the past week in response to a request by The Post.\n\nTrump and his lawyers have vigorously disputed the allegations, predicting that they will win in court and reopen the business. They point to positive customer-satisfaction surveys that have been submitted in the lawsuits and suggest they have been unfairly targeted by trial lawyers and a politically motivated attorney general in New York.\n\n\u201cWe continue to believe that people got substantial value and that people were overwhelmingly satisfied,\u201d said Trump\u2019s general counsel, Alan Garten. \u201cWe are not going to be stopping what we are doing. We are going to continue to zealously defend this case because, at the end of the day, we know we are not being tried by The Washington Post or by CNN \u2014 but in a courtroom by a jury.\u201d\n\nGarten acknowledged that Trump never gave away the profits to charity. He said it was always Trump\u2019s intention but that the lawyers leading the class-action suits against the company \u201cgot a hold of this and .\u2009.\u2009. whatever profits existed sort of evaporated.\u201d The unfulfilled promise was first reported last year by Time magazine.\n\nIn his defense, Trump has often cited the many positive reviews by former customers. A number of them submitted sworn statements in court explaining their positive experiences at Trump University.\n\nKissy and Mark Gordon, who own a residential development company in Virginia and jointly signed up for the most expensive program in 2008, said in an interview that they still use techniques they learned from the course today.\n\n\u201cDid we have an expectation that Trump was going to teach us? No,\u201d Kissy Gordon said. \u201cWe have a building background and the economy changed, and we were looking for something in the same field to do something with it. So we were there to learn.\u201d\n\nGregory Leishman, another former customer, recalled speaking to his assigned Trump University mentor on the phone weekly and touring potential properties for purchase with him in New Haven, Conn. \u201cThey gave me information I didn\u2019t have otherwise,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can probably get all that information from reading books. But Trump University was a crash course. You pay more, you get more.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the company has emerged as one of the most potent lines of attack against Trump\u2019s campaign for president.\n\nIn the Republican primary, Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.) cited it as a \u201cfake university\u201d and sought to use it to help build a case that Trump was a \u201ccon artist.\u201d\n\nIn recent days, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton and her campaign have picked up on that theme.\n\n\u201cTrump U is devastating because its a metaphor for his whole campaign: promising hardworking Americans a way to get ahead, but all based on lies,\u201d tweeted press secretary Brian Fallon.\n\nTrump also last week invited a torrent of criticism, including from legal scholars on the left and right, for accusing the judge presiding over the California suits, U.S. District Judge Gonzalo Curiel, of being biased because he is of Mexican descent. Trump has said that Curiel is \u201cMexican,\u201d although the 62-year-old was born in Indiana, and that because Trump wants to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border the judge cannot properly do his job.\n\nThe focus on Trump University also reignited a controversy in Texas over the decision there by the state attorney general not to file a fraud case against the business. Newly disclosed documents reported by Texas media show that investigators had probed the company for seven months and recommended a lawsuit. The inquiry was shut down when Trump University closed up shop in the state.\n\nTrump later gave $35,000 to the gubernatorial campaign of then-Attorney General Greg Abbott. A spokesman for Abbott, now the Republican governor of Texas, has said it\u2019s \u201cabsurd\u201d to suggest a connection between the case and the donation that came several years later and that Trump University was \u201cforced out of Texas and consumers were protected.\u201d\n\nGarten also dismissed any connection between the Texas decision and Trump\u2019s donation, saying investigators reviewed \u201ca few complaints .\u2009.\u2009. and decided not to proceed.\u201d\n\nThe Trump University sales pitch began at free seminars, such as one hosted at a Holiday Inn just outside of Washington in 2009.\n\n[In downturn, aspiring moguls turn to Trump U. for wisdom]\n\nA placard outside the ballroom read, \u201cTrump, think BIG.\u201d Inside, aspiring real estate investors heard the theme song from \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d the O\u2019Jays classic, \u201cFor the Love of Money.\u201d\n\nThen, a Trump University instructor took the microphone. \u201cAll right, you guys ready to be the next Trump real estate millionaire? Yes or No!?\u201d he yelled, according to a Post account at the time.\n\nThe purpose of these free 90-minute introductions was not to turn attendees into millionaires, but rather to \u201cset the hook\u201d for future sales, according to employee playbooks.\n\nThe playbooks directed leaders of the free seminars to conclude introductory events by getting \u201cin the sales mindset,\u201d \u201cready to sell, sell, sell!\u201d\n\nThree-day courses typically cost $1,495, the records show. But people who paid to attend them were then urged to sign up for even pricier \u201celite\u201d programs.\n\nA \u201cworkshop enrollment form\u201d distributed to participants laid out the options in categories, starting with the \u201cTrump Gold Elite\u201d program. At $34,995, it was the most expensive option \u2014 providing three days of personal, in-the-field mentorship as well as special programs on real estate investment, \u201cwealth preservation\u201d and \u201ccreative financing.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cTrump Silver Elite\u201d package, priced at $19,495, offered real estate and finance training. The \u201cTrump Bronze Elite,\u201d priced at $9,995, offered similar, but fewer, courses.\n\nEmployees distributed \u201cprofile\u201d surveys on the first day of the seminars, in which participants would outline their financial goals, as well as current assets and liabilities. Attendees were told that the information would help them figure out how much they had to invest in real estate, according to customer complaints.\n\nBut in the evenings, after seminars had concluded for the first day, staff members were instructed to use the information to rank each participant according to assets they had available to spend on more Trump University programs.\n\n\u201cIf they can afford the gold elite,\u201d the playbook advised, \u201cdon\u2019t allow them to think about doing anything besides the gold elite.\u201d\n\nA 43-page \u201csales playbook\u201d offered guidance on using psychological tools to convince students that they needed to sign up for the classes to fulfill their own goals \u2014 overcoming their worries that they might not need or be able to afford the classes.\n\n\u201cCustomers don\u2019t have needs \u2014 they have problems,\u201d the book advised. \u201cProblems are like health. The more a problem hurts now, the more the need for a solution now. And the more it hurts, the more they\u2019ll be prepared to pay for a speedy solution.\u201d\n\nIn a section devoted to \u201cnegotiating student resistance,\u201d sales people were offered sample responses to common objections from potential students. If a potential customer said he was concerned about going into debt to pay for the classes, staff were advised to needle them: \u201cI see, do you like living paycheck to paycheck?\u201d\n\nIf doubts persisted, staffers were advised to invoke the big boss himself.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump won\u2019t listen to excuses and neither will we,\u201d the instructors were told to say.\n\nFormer students have said they were instructed to call their credit card companies on the spot and raise their borrowing limit to pay for the program.\n\nHarris, the former instructor, recalled one of his typical pitches to urge customers to find money for programs: \u201cDo you have any equity on your home? Do you have a 401(k) or IRA?\u201d\n\nHarris, 47, said he was one of Trump University\u2019s biggest sellers. Garten, Trump\u2019s lawyer, said Harris was one of the most highly rated instructors.\n\nInstructors had to sell hard to turn participants at free seminars into paying customers.\n\nFor the four years Trump University operated, more than 80,300 people attended the free introductory sessions. Those previews were offered 2,000 times in nearly 700 locations around the country.\n\nBut only around 6,000 people paid between $995 and $1,995 to attend three-day seminars, director of operations Mark Covais said in a 2012 affidavit. According to Covais, 572 people paid the full $34,995 for the top-level Trump University mentorship.\n\nThe entire program was built around Trump \u2014 his picture, his quotes and the promise of obtaining access to his special formula for prosperity.\n\nOne ad for the free Trump University seminars that appeared in a Corpus Christi, Tex., newspaper in 2009 promised attendees that they would \u201cLearn from the Master,\u201d below a picture of Trump.\n\n\u201cI can turn anyone into a successful real estate investor,\u201d read a quote on the ad, attributed to Trump.\n\nThe California class-action lawsuit contains 49 separate instances of Trump University attendees being told their instructor or future mentor was personally chosen by Trump in 2009 alone.\n\n\u201cDonald Trump personally picked me,\u201d one instructor told a group at a free seminar in May 2009, according to a transcript of the session filed as part of the New York case. \u201cHe could have picked anybody in this world but he picked me and the reason he picked me is because I\u2019ve been very, very successful helping average people make a lot of money.\u201d\n\nHarris, the former instructor, told an introductory meeting of potential customers in 2009 that Trump\u2019s personal generosity was a core element of the program.\n\n\u201cHe did not have to start this university,\u201d Harris told the group, according to a transcript in the New York case. \u201cHe does not need the money. .\u2009.\u2009. He does not get a dime of it. Does everyone understand this? Please say \u2018yes.\u2019 He does not need the money.\u201d\n\nIn one presentation cited in the New York lawsuit, Harris described Trump as instrumental to his own efforts to turn his life around just after high school.\n\n\u201cI lived on the streets of New York, mostly down in the subways for the first nine months, and I did a lot of things to make some money,\u201d he told a group attending a 2008 event. \u201cAnd then I met a gentleman and he took me in, and I lived with him for a year and he taught me how to do real estate. He is still my mentor today. So the reason I am here is because Donald Trump picked me.\u201d\n\nIn an interview, Harris said he met Trump once in the early 1990s, backstage at an event at the Taj Mahal casino. \u201cHere is the truth,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen I was at Trump University, I had not one interaction with him ever. Not one.\u201d\n\nIn reality, the instructors were not close to Trump, and many were not experts in real estate, according to several ex-staffers who have testified in the lawsuits.\n\n\u201cThe Trump University instructors and mentors were a joke,\u201d said Jason Nicholas, who worked for the company for seven months in 2007 and submitted a statement in the lawsuit. \u201cIn my opinion, it was just selling false hopes and lies.\u201d\n\nMichael Sexton, who was president of Trump University, acknowledged in sworn testimony in the New York case that none of the event instructors were hand-picked by Trump. Trump told lawyers in California that he would not dispute Sexton\u2019s statement \u2014 nor could he remember a series of instructors, including Harris, by name or face.\n\nTrump also did not review course curriculum, Sexton said.\n\n\u201cHe would never do that,\u201d Sexton said. \u201cMr. Trump is not going to go through a 300-page, you know, binder of content.\u201d\n\nOnly when it came to marketing material was Trump deeply involved, reviewing every piece of advertisement, Sexton testified.\n\n\u201cMr. Trump understandably is protective of his brand and very protective of his image and how he\u2019s portrayed,\u201d Sexton said. \u201cAnd he wanted to see how his brand and image were portrayed in Trump University marketing materials. And he had very good and substantive input as well.\u201d\n\nGarten, the Trump attorney, said Trump was engaged as any CEO would be in the operations. Outside experts designed the curriculum, Garten said, but Trump was \u201cintimately involved\u201d in the process. While Trump may not have selected every instructor, Garten said he was \u201cvery much involved in the process and the discussion of what type of instructor was desired.\u201d\n\nAt the courses, students were supposed to learn Trump\u2019s secrets of real estate success.\n\nBut in sworn testimony in New York, Sexton could recall only one Trump practice that was incorporated into the courses: Invest in foreclosed properties.\n\nThe lesson underscored how Trump University, which was formed to teach aspiring business people to profit from the fast-expanding housing market, tailored itself after the 2008 economic crash to offer guidance on profiting from the aftermath.\n\nOne ad placed in the San Antonio Express-News in October 2009 promised that seminars would allow participants to \u201clearn from Donald Trump\u2019s handpicked experts how you can profit from the largest real estate liquidation in history.\u201d\n\nAt a seminar called \u201cFast Track to Foreclosure,\u201d students were instructed to find OPM, \u201cother people\u2019s money,\u201d to buy homes out of foreclosure at depressed prices, dress them up with new paint and attractive landscaping \u2014 then flip them for profit.\n\nAttendees were advised to use credit cards to invest in real estate, and they were told how to persuade credit card companies to raise their credit limits. If a credit card company representative asked for their income, they were advised to add $75,000 in anticipated earnings from their real estate venture before providing a figure for their expected earnings for the year.\n\nSome customers have also alleged they were told there would be a personal appearance at the session by Trump. Instead, they received the opportunity to get their photograph taken with a life-size cardboard cutout of the mogul.\n\nJohn Brown, a customer who provided a sworn statement in the New York case, described how he \u201ccame to realize that I was not adequately trained, which caused me to feel that Trump University had taken advantage of me.\u201d\n\nBrown said he paid $1,495 for a three-day seminar in 2009 and then used multiple credit cards to charge a $24,995 Trump mentorship program. Three years later, he said he had made no real estate investments using Trump knowledge \u2014 but was still paying off $20,000 from the courses.\n\n\u201cBecause of the Trump name,\u201d he said, \u201cI felt these classes would be the best.\u201d", "253": "Trump Has Forever Changed American Politics > November 7, 2016, 9:46 pm A+ | a- Warning   \n\u201cIf I don\u2019t win, this will be the greatest waste of time, money and energy in my lifetime,\u201d says Donald Trump. \nHerewith, a dissent. Whatever happens Tuesday, Trump has made history and has forever changed American politics. \nThough a novice in politics, he captured the Party of Lincoln with the largest turnout of primary voters ever, and he has inflicted wounds on the nation\u2019s ruling class from which it may not soon recover. \nBush I and II, Mitt Romney , the neocons and the GOP commentariat all denounced Trump as morally and temperamentally unfit. Yet, seven of eight Republicans are voting for Trump, and he drew the largest and most enthusiastic crowds of any GOP nominee. \nNot only did he rout the Republican elites, he ash-canned their agenda and repudiated the wars into which they plunged the country. \nTrump did not create the forces that propelled his candidacy. But he recognized them, tapped into them, and unleashed a gusher of nationalism and populism that will not soon dissipate. \nWhatever happens Tuesday, there is no going back now. \nHow could the Republican establishment advance anew the trade and immigration policies that their base has so thunderously rejected? \nHow can the GOP establishment credibly claim to speak for a party that spent the last year cheering a candidate who repudiated the last two Republican presidents and the last two Republican nominees? \nDo mainstream Republicans think that should Trump lose a Bush Restoration lies ahead? The dynasty is as dead as the Romanovs . \nThe media, whose reputation has sunk to Congressional depths, has also suffered a blow to its credibility. \nIts hatred of Trump has been almost manic, and WikiLeaks revelations of the collusion between major media and Clintonites have convinced skeptics that the system is rigged and the referees of democracy are in the tank. \nBut it is the national establishment that has suffered most. \nThe Trump candidacy exposed what seems an unbridgeable gulf between this political class and the nation in whose name it purports to speak. \nConsider the litany of horrors it has charged Trump with. \nHe said John McCain was no hero, that some Mexican illegals are \u201c rapists .\u201d He mocked a handicapped reporter. He called some women \u201cpigs.\u201d He wants a temporary ban to Muslim immigration. He fought with a Gold Star mother and father. He once engaged in \u201c fat-shaming \u201d a Miss Universe, calling her \u201cMiss Piggy, \u201d and telling her to stay out of Burger King. He allegedly made crude advances on a dozen women and starred in the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape with Billy Bush. \nWhile such \u201cgaffes\u201d are normally fatal for candidates, Trump\u2019s followers stood by him through them all. \nWhy? asks an alarmed establishment. Why, in spite of all this, did Trump\u2019s support endure? Why did the American people not react as they once would have? Why do these accusations not have the bite they once did? \nAnswer. We are another country now, an us-or-them country. \nMiddle America believes the establishment is not looking out for the nation but for retention of its power. And in attacking Trump it is not upholding some objective moral standard but seeking to destroy a leader who represents a grave threat to that power. \nTrump\u2019s followers see an American Spring as crucial, and they are not going to let past boorish behavior cause them to abandon the last best chance to preserve the country they grew up in. \nThese are the Middle American Radicals, the MARs of whom my late friend Sam Francis wrote. \nThey recoil from the future the elites have mapped out for them and, realizing the stakes, will overlook the faults and failings of a candidate who holds out the real promise of avoiding that future. \nThey believe Trump alone will secure the borders and rid us of a trade regime that has led to the loss of 70,000 factories and 5 million manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. They believe Trump is the best hope for keeping us out of the wars the Beltway think tanks are already planning for the sons of the \u201cdeplorables\u201d to fight. \nMoreover, they see the establishment as the quintessence of hypocrisy. Trump is instructed to stop using such toxic phrases as \u201cAmerica First\u201d and \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d by elites who think 55 million abortions since Roe is a milestone of moral progress. \nAnd what do they have in common with a woman who thinks partial-birth abortion, which her predecessor in the Senate, Pat Moynihan, called \u201c infanticide ,\u201d is among the cherished \u201creproductive rights\u201d of women? \nWhile a Trump victory would create the possibility of a coalition of conservatives, populists, patriots and nationalists governing America, should he lose, America\u2019s future appears disunited and grim. \nBut, would the followers of Donald Trump, whom Hillary Clinton has called \u201cracist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic \u2026 bigots,\u201d to the cheers of her media retainers, unite behind her should she win? \nNo. Win or lose, as Sen. Edward Kennedy said at the Democratic Convention of 1980, \u201cThe work goes on, the cause endures.\u201d", "254": "With\u00a0Western and Iranian negotiators racing toward a June 30 deadline\u00a0to hammer out the final details of a nuclear deal, the mood is tense. Just take a look at Twitter, where Secretary of State\u00a0John Kerry\u2019s senior communications adviser\u00a0Marie Harf\u00a0is feuding with a reporter.", "255": "The role of the US and Nato in EU relations with China by Manlio Dinucci Participating in an international conference, the Italian geographer Manlio Dinucci ties together the various strands of his analysis of the weapons that the US has at its disposal to dominate the entire world. Yet the importance of this article goes beyond that. For it is on account of this domination, this unipolar global order, that Syria, Russia and China, challenge today the use of force.\nVoltaire Network | Rome (Italy) | 28 October 2016 fran\u00e7ais Espa\u00f1ol I will get straight to the heart of the issue. I do not think it possible to speak of relations between the European Union (the EU) and China independently of the influence the United States wields over the EU directly and [indirectly], through Nato.\nToday 22 of the 28 (27 once Great Britain has left the EU), EU member states with more than 90% of the EU population, are members of Nato, recognized as the \u201cfoundation for collective defence\u201d. And Nato is under US command: the US Supreme Allied Command in Europe is always appointed by the US President and all the other key commands are in the US\u2019s hands. Accordingly, the EU\u2019s foreign and military policy is fundamentally subordinated to the US strategy to which the major European powers have aligned themselves.\nSuch a strategy, clearly announced in official documents, is sketched out at that moment in history when, following the dissolution of the URSS, the world situation changes. In 1991, the White House declares in the National Security Strategy of the United States :\n\u201cThe United States remains the only State with the force, capability and influence in every dimension \u2013 political, economic and military \u2013 that is effectively global. Nothing can substitute for US leadership\u201d.\nIn 1992, in the Defense Planning Guidance , the Pentagon emphasizes:\n\u201cOur primary objective is to prevent any hostile power dominating a region whose resources would be sufficient to generate a global power. These regions include Western Europe, Eastern Asia, the territory of the former Soviet Union and South-West Asia\u201d.\nIn 2001, in the report Quadrennial Defense Review \u2013 published a week before the US/Nato war in Afghanistan, an area of primary geostrategic importance in relation to Russia and China - the Pentagon announces:\n\u201cIt is possible that a military rival may emerge in Asia with a formidable resource base. US armed forces must maintain their capabilities to impose the US\u2019s will on any adversary, so as to change the regime of an enemy state or to occupy a foreign territory so that US strategic objectives can be realized\u201d.\nOn the basis of this strategy, US-led Nato, has launched an offensive on the Eastern front: after demolishing by war the Federation of Yugoslavia, from 1999 to date, it has subsumed all the countries of the former Warsaw Pact, three of the former Yugoslavia, three of the former URSS and very soon will incorporate others (starting from Georgia and Ukraine \u2013 the latter a de facto Nato member), moving bases and forces, nuclear included, ever closer to the Russian borders.\nAt the same time, on the Southern front, closely connected to the Eastern front, the war waged by the US-led Nato has demolished the Libyan State and has tried to do the same thing with the Syrian State.\nUSA and Nato have tried to make the Ukraine crisis explode and, accusing Russia of \u201cdestabilizing European security\u201d, have dragged Europe into a new Cold War, intended particularly by Washington (at the cost of European economies damaged by sanctions and counter-sanctions) to fracture EU\u2013Russian political and economic relations damaged by US interests. This same strategy also includes an increasing deployment of US military forces in the Asia/Pacific region for anti-Chinese reasons. The U.S. Navy has announced that in 2020 it will concentrate 60% of its naval and air forces in this region.\nThe US strategy is focused on the South China Sea and Admiral Harris, head of the US Command for the Pacific, emphasizes the importance of this: through this sea passes maritime trade with an annual value of more than 5,000 billion dollars, including 25% from global export of oil and 50% of natural gas. The US wants to control these routes in the name of which Admiral Harris defines \u201cthe freedom of navigation fundamental for our way of life here in the US\u201d, accusing China, in his very words of \u201caggressive actions in the South China Sea, similar to Russian action in the Crimea\u201d. For this, the US Navy \u201cis patrolling\u201d the South China Sea. Riding on the back of the US, the biggest European powers arrive: last July, France has requested the European Union to \u201ccoordinate the naval surveillance of the South China Sea to ensure a regular and visible presence in these waters over which China has illegally asserted title\u201d. And while the US established in South Korea anti-missile systems which are also capable of launching nuclear missiles, similar to those installed against Russia in Romania and very shortly in Poland, as well as on board the war ships in the Mediterranean, on 6 October, the Nato Secretary General Stoltenberg receives South Korea\u2019s Minister for Foreign Affairs at Brussels, to \u201cstrengthen Nato\u2019s partnership with Seoul\u201d.\nThese and other facts demonstrate that the same strategy is implemented in Europe and Asia. It is the extreme attempt of the United States and other Western Powers to maintain their economic, political and military supremacy in a world, radically transformed, where new states and social subjects are emerging. The Shanghai Organization for Co-operation, born out of a strategic Chinese-Russian agreement, provides resources and working capacities, making it the biggest integrated economic area in the world. The Shanghai and BRICS organizations are capable, with their financial organizations, of largely displacing the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund that, for more than 70 years, have allowed the USA and major western powers to dominate the global economy through loans that fetter the economic sovereignty of indebted countries and other financial instruments. The new organizations can, at the same time, achieve a de-dollarization of their trade agreements, depriving the US of its capacity to off-load its debt on the other countries, by printing dollar notes used as the dominant international currency.\nTo maintain its supremacy, increasingly wavering, the US relies not only on the strength of its weapons, but also weapons more efficient than \u201cweapons\u201d in the strict sense of the word.\nThe first weapon: the so-called \u201cFree Trade Agreements\u201d such as the \u201cTransatlantic Partnership on Trade and Investment\u201d (TTIP) between the USA and the EU and the \u201cTranspacific Partnership\u201d (TPP), both of which have economic, geopolitical and geostrategic objectives. This is why, Hillary Clinton defines the EU-US partnership \u201cthe biggest strategic aim of our transatlantic alliance\u201d, proposing an \u201cEconomic Nato\u201d that integrates that the political with the military. The plan is clear: to form a political, economic and military US-EU block, increasingly under US command which acts as a countervailing force to the following:\n\u2022 the Eurasiatic area, now on the rise and based on cooperation between China and Russia;\n\u2022 the Brics; and\n\u2022 Iran and any other country that manages to escape Western domination.\nThe TTIP negotiations are struggling to make headway due to a conflict of interests and vast opposition in Europe. But that obstacle is now circumvented through the \u201cComprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement\u201d (CETA) between Canada and the EU: a TTIP in disguise, given that Canada is already party to NAFTA which also binds the USA. The EU will probably sign off CETA when the Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau visits Brussels this 27 October.\nThe second weapon: penetrating the target countries from within. Leverage is drawn from the weak points that each country has to varying extents: corruption, a greed for money, political ascent, secessionary movements fed by local power groups, religious fanaticism, the vulnerability of the great masses for political demagogy. Playing as well, in certain cases, on a justified popular dissatisfaction with the actions of their own government. The instruments used to penetrate? The so-called \u201cnon-governmental organizations\u201d. These are, in actual fact, the long hand of the Department of State and the CIA. These NGOs, endowed with deep pools of financial resources, have organized the Eastern European \u201ccolour revolutions\u201d and replicated the same operation with the so-called \u201cUmbrella Revolution\u201d in Hong Kong, aiming at developing similar movements in other parts of China where the national minorities live. The same organizations operate in Latin America, with the primary objective of subverting Brazil\u2019s democratic institutions, thereby threatening Brics from within. Instruments to achieve the strategy are terrorist groups, such as those armed and infiltrated in Libya and Syria to sow seeds of chaos, contributing to destruction of whole States attacked at the same time from outside.\nThe third arm: \u201cPsyops\u201d (Psychological operations), launched through the global media chains, defined as follows by the Pentagon: \u201cPlanned Operations to influence, through specific information, the emotions and mindset, and thus the conduct of public opinion, organizations and foreign governments, so as to induce or strengthen conduct favourable to pre-established objectives\u201d.\nSuch operations, prepare public opinion for warlike escalation and create the impression that Russia is responsible for tensions in Europe just as China is for the tensions in Asia, as well as accusing them at the same time of \u201cviolating human rights\u201d.\n1965: Manlio Dinucci, and his wife, Carla, before the ancestral home of Mao Tse Toung. A final consideration: during the sixties, my wife and I worked in Peking, contributing, inter alia, to the publication of the first Chinese journal in the Italian language. I experienced a life-changing learning experience when China \u2013 liberated from the colonial, semi-colonial and semi-feudal conditions for at least 15 years \u2013 was completely isolated. Neither the West nor the United Nations recognized it as a sovereign state. This period imprinted on my mind, the ability of the Chinese people (at the time totalling 600 million), to resist, their consciousness and commitment under the guide of the Communist party to constructing a society with a brand new economic and cultural foundation. I think that this capacity is today still needed so that today\u2019s China, that is developing its enormous potential, can resist new plans for imperial domination and contribute to the decisive struggle for the future of humanity: a world free of wars; where peace, inextricably linked to social justice, prevails.\nManlio Dinucci Translation\nAnoosha Boralessa", "256": "RALEIGH, N.C.\u2014Ayana McAllister went to Hillary Clinton\u2019s rally two weekends ago at St. Augustine\u2019s University, the historically-black school where she\u2019s a freshman. She watched the Democratic nominee speak alongside the mothers of Trayvon Martin and Sandra Bland. But on the eve of the election, the 18-year-old is still not 100 percent sold.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d said McAllister, a native of Largo, Md. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve got to settle for Hillary. I feel like I\u2019m going to vote because I know I need to, not because I want to. I feel like neither of them should be president, but I feel like Hillary will be better. Really, it\u2019s like two children arguing back and forth.\u201d\n\nThis was a common refrain during interviews at yesterday\u2019s football game here between St. Augustine and crosstown rival Shaw University, another historically-black institution.\n\n-- Early voting numbers and polling suggest that African American turnout is down nationally this year compared to 2012 and 2008. Though there are some signs that the gap has been closing in recent days, alarm bells have clearly gone off inside the Clinton high command.\n\n-- Many students at the schools here in Raleigh regret that they never got to vote for Barack Obama. They are collectively disappointed that their first time forces them to choose between Clinton and Donald Trump, but they plan to vote nonetheless. In fact, teachers have told them that in lieu of class they will march to the polls on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI am not a fan of either one, but of the two I will probably be voting for Hillary,\u201d said Anoviua Rush, a freshman from Durham. \u201cShe\u2019s just a liar. And Hillary is not even good at backing up her lies. Everyone makes mistakes, but when you try to cover them up it\u2019s a problem.\u201d\n\nAs a marching band performed behind her, under a cloudless sky on a perfect fall day, Rush explained that the prospect of electing the first woman president does not motivate her, but Clinton\u2019s support for equal pay legislation does. \u201cShe\u2019s more understanding of minorities and what we go through,\u201d said Rush. \u201cI\u2019m not going to say he\u2019s \u2018racist,\u2019 but he\u2019s said some messed up stuff about minorities. \u2026 Donald\u2019s main focus seems to be helping the wealthy and, I\u2019ll say it, possibly Caucasians.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cA lot of people are very discouraged. Very, very discouraged,\u201d said Felishia McPherson, 47, who was wearing a \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d t-shirt. \u201cReally, it\u2019s like you\u2019re choosing between a liar and a clown. But who doesn\u2019t lie? We all lie. \u2026 I\u2019m a mental health counselor. I know that, psychologically, in order to want to be president, you\u2019ve got to be a little narcissistic to start with. \u2026 Trump was never an option for me. I don\u2019t love Hillary, but I don\u2019t have to. She\u2019s not coming to my house. She\u2019s going to the White House.\u201d\n\nMcPherson already voted early for Clinton. She brought her seven-year-old niece Malia, named after the president\u2019s daughter, to Obama\u2019s rally in Fayetteville on Friday. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I actually believe in the political system, as far as does my one vote count? But I\u2019m not going to take a chance of it not counting,\u201d she explained afterward. \u201cIf the system really does work, then I\u2019m going to participate. If it doesn\u2019t, then I still did the best I could by my ancestors. \u2026 I do believe, with Obama\u2019s encouragement, even though we may not believe in the system, we know we need to do it.\u201d\n\n-- Several elderly African Americans expressed deep concern that millennials, including their grandchildren, do not sufficiently appreciate the importance of voting. Irene Hill-Thomas, 79, is a retired special education teacher who now spends most of her time volunteering at church and a food pantry in Sampson County. \u201cIf you\u2019ve been around long enough, your eyes are open,\u201d she said. \u201cYou appreciate it because you fought for it. The younger generation hasn\u2019t been there. They don\u2019t know. The younger generation doesn\u2019t understand there was a time when we had to sit at the back of the bus and had no say so. \u2026 I remember the white and the colored fountains. They don\u2019t.\u201d\n\n-- North Carolina was the closest state Obama won in 2008 and the closest state he lost in 2012. African Americans accounted for 23 percent of the electorate both times, and Obama won almost all of them.\n\nReflecting the importance of the 15 electoral votes up for grabs in North Carolina, and the strategic significance of the Research Triangle specifically, both candidates will return to Raleigh on Monday. Trump will give an afternoon speech at the state fairgrounds, and Clinton will hold the final rally of her campaign here -- at midnight.\n\n-- Another very important explanation for why African American turnout is down in North Carolina: Republicans have worked to limit early voting locations and hours. The executive director of the state Republican Party persuaded GOP county officials to limit early voting in troubling emails that have been unearthed by public records requests. He pushed to limit the number of hours sites were open, especially evenings and Sundays, when many African Americans typically cast ballots (after church services).\n\nIn the Democratic-leaning county that includes Greensboro \u2013 the state\u2019s third largest \u2013 there were 16 early voting sites in 2012 during the first week that polls were open. This year there was just one. So while 61,000 people voted during the first week four years ago, only 8,000 did this year. (After that first week, 25 voting sites were opened and turnout records were broken.)\n\n-- I shadowed a field staffer from the AFL-CIO affiliate group Working America as she canvassed in a predominantly black section of Raleigh yesterday afternoon. Walking across lawns in a hilly neighborhood just off Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd., Andrea Vogler urged folks to go vote.\n\nDuring a period of just one hour, though, half a dozen African Americans separately complained that they tried to vote early but the lines were too long. So they came home. They all said they hope to still go on Tuesday, but what if the lines are long then too? Will they stick around?\n\nA woman in a nurse\u2019s uniform said she went by the early voting site three times over the past week, but the lines were too long each time.\n\nA younger man named Victor came to his door in red-checkered pajamas. He had gone earlier in the day too but said he was too tired to stand around. He works a night shift, so he said he\u2019s going to try voting on his drive home from work at 6:30 a.m. Tuesday \u2013 which he hopes will be before a crowd forms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve heard that on a couple of different days now,\u201d Vogler, 32, lamented as she walked to the next house. \u201cOn the one hand, it is good people are trying to vote. On the other, I hope it doesn\u2019t deter anyone from actually voting.\u201d\n\nA woman named Barbara, pulling out of her driveway in a Chevy Trailblazer with her infant son in the backseat, is one of the people who gave up when she saw the lines.\n\nDamien, her husband, was who Vogler had come to talk with. Barbara warned her that he was sleeping. But every vote counts, so the canvasser went to knock on the door anyway. He was nonplussed. \u201cI worked all damn night, 12 hours,\u201d he said, his eyes bloodshot. \u201cI just want to go back to my bed.\u201d She tried to hand him a piece of paper with bullet points on why he should vote for Clinton. He grimaced and refused to take it.\n\nWorking America has about 700 field staffers farmed out across nine states. They have had 573,400 conversations with voters since launching this summer, including 45,500 in North Carolina. In the Raleigh area alone, the labor group had seven vans with five to seven people in each hitting doors on Saturday. The group largely targets African American and Latino voters, though some swing white\u00a0Republicans are in their universe.\n\nAn older man sitting in his green Chevy Lumina, picking his teeth with a toothpick outside a row of ground-level studio apartments, told Vogler that he planned to vote later in the afternoon. She informed him that early voting had ended for the day, and that Saturday was the final opportunity until Tuesday. \u201cDamn,\u201d he replied.\n\n\u201cNorth Carolina is the most important state,\u201d Vogler stressed over and over again. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get out to vote!\u201d\n\n-- In an interview late last night, I asked Democratic Senate candidate Deborah Ross \u2013 who is in a neck-and-neck race with Sen. Richard Burr that may decide which party controls the majority \u2013 about all these people who said they did not vote early because of the lines. \u201cIt\u2019s by design,\u201d she complained. But she argued that this will also galvanize many African Americans on Tuesday. \u201cI don\u2019t think anything is going to keep people from voting this year,\u201d she said.\n\nRoss, a former state representative who sponsored 2007 legislation allowing for same-day voter registration (which was pivotal to Obama carrying the state a year later), noted that, for every person who returned home when they saw the crowded early voting sites, many more waited around. \u201cThere were people who stood for hours in line,\u201d she said.\n\nThe weather forecast for Tuesday looks good, and she believes this might make the difference in her \u201crazor thin\u201d race. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see long lines on Election Day,\u201d Ross predicted, with a southern twang. \u201cWe\u2019re going to turn people out.\u201d\n\nA Clinton campaign official, speaking anonymously, said they were worried during the first week of early voting, but the fact that hundreds of additional sites wound up opening for the second week made the situation much better and led to a huge increase in turnout. But allies say Clinton may need to perform especially well on Election Day to offset votes that were lost over the past two weeks.\n\nSurrogates have also streamed into the state to drive African Americans to the polls. Civil rights icon John Lewis headlined a march in Charlotte on Thursday. Cory Booker came Friday night. Other efforts are underway too. The national president of the Sierra Club was outside the St. Augustine\u2019s football game handing out biscuits from Bojangles\u2019 and urging young people to support Clinton in order to advance environmental issues.\n\n-- The president himself has now spoken at five rallies for Clinton in North Carolina. Addressing a crowd of 2,500 that was probably 95 percent black in Fayetteville on Friday, he made a very explicit pitch. \u201cRight now, Donald Trump is calling on his supporters to monitor \u2018certain areas\u2019 on Election Day,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI don\u2019t know what \u2018certain areas\u2019 he\u2019s talking about, but you do.\u201d\n\nHe finished his speech with the story of a 100-year-old woman who was purged from the North Carolina voter rolls after a Republican challenged her registration status on flimsy grounds. Grace Bell Hardison was mentioned in an NAACP lawsuit that prompted a federal judge to issue an injunction on Friday. North Carolina election officials are now scrambling to restore the rights of thousands of voters \u2013 most black and Democratic -- who had been cut from the rolls under a so-called \u201cindividual challenge law.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo, young people, I want you to understand this,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that long ago when folks had to guess the number of jellybeans in a jar (or) the number of bubbles on a bar of soap.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t that long ago folks were beaten trying to register voters in Mississippi. \u2026 If you\u2019ve been marching for criminal justice reform, that\u2019s great. But you still need to vote! \u2026 If you vote, we\u2019ll win North Carolina. And if we win North Carolina, Hillary Clinton will be president.\u201d\n\nWHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:\n\n-- Trump was rushed offstage during a campaign rally in Reno last night after a man reportedly yelled \u201cgun,\u201d but the GOP nominee emerged back onstage after a brief period to finish his speech.\u00a0Secret Service officials said agents apprehended the man but found no weapon.\u00a0The man, who identified himself as Austyn Crites, 33, was reportedly released after the event, telling reporters that he was attacked for holding a \u201cRepublicans against Trump\u201d sign. \u201cWhen I pulled out the sign, people around me were trying to grab the sign,\u201d Crites said. \u201cAnd so all that was occurring was booing, of course. That\u2019s what you would expect.\u201d He said that the crowd tackled him, and began \u201ckicking me and grabbing me in the crotch and just, just beating the crap out of me.\u201d (Jose A. DelReal, Anne Gearan and Ed O'Keefe\u00a0have more.)\n\n-- Donald Trump Jr. and top campaign social media aide Dan Scavino immediately retweeted unsubstantiated claims that Trump had just survived an attack on his life: \u201cHillary ran away from the rain today. Trump is back onstage minutes after assassination attempt,\u201d the tweet read.\n\n-- Meanwhile, a\u00a0man wearing a mask and carrying a gun was arrested near the White House following a struggle with authorities.\u00a0Immediate details surrounding the incident are unclear, but the Secret Service says he's being charged with carrying a firearm without a license, carrying unregistered ammunition, resisting arrest and committing a crime while wearing a mask. (Martin Weil)\n\n-- A press bus following Tim Kaine in Tampa was hit \u201cat high speed\" on Sunday evening, according to several people onboard.\u00a0One reporter said the bus was hit by what appeared to be a police car. But there were no reports of injuries and the bus continued. Kaine was several cars ahead of the press bus, according to reporters in his motorcade.\n\n-- Our WaPo/ABC News tracking poll finds Clinton leading Trump nationally by five points -- 48 percent to 43 percent -- widening last week\u2019s tight race as she shows\u00a0clear advantages on several personal attributes:\n\n-- The Wall Street Journal/NBC poll finds Clinton up a similar four points (44-40). Clinton\u2019s lead is less than half of the 11-point advantage she held in their mid-October survey, taken before the FBI email announcement. A wide swath of Trump\u2019s support also comes from within his own party, as Republican voters rally around the nominee in the final stretch of the campaign.\n\n-- A Des Moines Register/Mediacom poll shows Trump with a seven point lead in IOWA, up three points from last month.\n\n-- A Columbus Dispatch poll shows Clinton eking out a single point lead over Trump in OHIO (48-47). Pollster Darrel Rowland says Clinton will \u201calmost certainly\u201d carry Ohio should enough young and minority voters show up to the polls. The same poll has Rob Portman crushing Ted Strickland by 21 points (58-37).LeBron James will appear alongside Clinton in Cleveland today on the\u00a0final day of early in-person voting in OHIO.\n\n-- The\u00a0CBS News battleground tracker\u00a0has Trump up 46-45 in OHIO and a 45-45 tie in FLORIDA.\n\nTHE FINAL SCHEDULES FOR BOTH CANDIDATES:\n\n-- What's with the\u00a011th-hour fluidity? Karen Tumulty and Dan Balz note that four states have dominated the Clinton campaign\u2019s calculation throughout the fall: Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania. \u201cObama won those four in 2008 and all of them but North Carolina in 2012. Until recently, it appeared that Trump needed to sweep all four to overcome Clinton\u2019s electoral-map advantage. But as the race has tightened, Ohio seems to have moved into the Republican column, and other states outside those four have potentially come into play. The GOP nominee is looking to states including Michigan (and) New Hampshire \u2026 to make up a potential deficit, should he not win Florida, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. ... In Trump\u2019s case, it is an effort to grab what he considers emerging opportunities in the sprint for the finish line; in Clinton\u2019s, as insurance against surprises Tuesday in territory she has considered hers.\u201d\u00a0(The Post\u2019s politics team lists the 15 states that will decide the election on Tuesday, breaking down the state of the race in each one.)\n\n-- Why is Michigan getting so much late attention?\u00a0Hillary campaigned in Detroit on Friday, and she\u2019s coming back to Grand Rapids tomorrow while Barack Obama flies to Ann Arbor. Bill is stumping in Lansing at 1 p.m. today. Remember that HRC unexpectedly lost the state\u2019s primary to Bernie Sanders in March, despite every poll putting her significantly ahead. Trump and Pence are also both going there.\u00a0Fourteen percent of the electorate is African American.\n\n-- The Clinton campaign is trying to downplay\u00a0its late efforts in Michigan. \u201cLook, if we hold onto Nevada (and) hold onto Michigan, then Hillary Clinton is going to be the next President of the United States,\u201d John Podesta said on Meet the Press this morning. \u201cMost people vote on election day in Michigan, so our schedule has been oriented to being in the early vote states, in the earlier period of time.\u201d Stephen Neuman, a senior adviser to the Democratic coordinated campaign in Michigan, noted that the campaign already has 35 offices. A Washington Post average of recent polls in the state has Clinton leading Trump in Michigan just 43 percent to 41 percent. Mook acknowledged that polls have has tightened in Michigan, but added: \u201cI feel very confident about how we\u2019re going to do.\u201d (John Wagner and Anne Gearan)\n\n-- Trump seems to have given up on Wisconsin. Aides told me last week that he\u2019d probably go back multiple times, including to the Milwaukee suburbs. He\u2019s not even going to come back once to the Badger State.\u00a0But now he\u2019s going to Minnesota (where he has absolutely not a snowball\u2019s chance). The campaign said it has done polling there, but Maggie Haberman of the Times tweeted that this is a lie.\n\n-- The latest indignity for the Speaker --> \"Trump cancels Wisconsin rally just as Paul Ryan says he would campaign with him,\" by\u00a0Jessie Opoien in the Madison Capital Times:\u00a0\u201cFor the second time in as many months, the possibility of a joint Paul Ryan-Donald Trump campaign appearance was floated and quickly yanked away. The Republican nominee earlier this week scheduled a Sunday afternoon rally in West Allis, just outside Milwaukee. It was to be Trump's sixth Wisconsin event since he lost the state's primary election. \u2018We don't know if it's scheduled firm or not yet, but I intend to do it if he's here,\u2019 Ryan told reporters Saturday when asked if he would attend the Trump rally. \u2026 \u2018If our nominee comes, we'll campaign with him.\u2019 \u2026 Seconds later, a spokesman for Trump's Wisconsin campaign alerted reporters that the event had been canceled.\u201d (Ryan stumped alongside Mike Pence yesterday.)\n\n-- But perplexingly Trump and Pence have not given up on VIRGINIA, adding several stops and deploying key surrogates.\u00a0\u201cTrump\u2019s decision to appear in a populous, purple Washington\u00a0exurb\u00a0cuts against his broader strategy of running up the vote in heavily red, rural areas,\u201d\u00a0Laura\u00a0Vozzella\u00a0writes. \u201cMuch of his last-minute appeals have been in tiny burgs like Selma, N.C., population 6,000. His foray into Northern Virginia appears to be a bid to hold down Clinton\u2019s margins in a region that, excluding the\u00a0exurbs, leans heavily Democratic.\u201d\n\n-- Bigger picture: Trump\u2019s schedule belies the biggest challenge facing him right now. It\u2019s not clear where and how he would win. \u201cOf all of [Trump\u2019s must-win] states, the only one where Mr. Trump has really been close in the polls is Nevada,\u201d\u00a0writes The\u00a0Upshot\u2019s Nate Cohn.\u00a0\u201cBut Nevada is also the state where we know the most about the results because of early voting, and it hasn't brought good news for Mr. Trump. \u2026 Perhaps Mr. Trump will mount a huge comeback in Nevada on Election Day. Or maybe Democrats are much weaker among registered Democrats or unaffiliated voters than most analysts believe. But if Mrs. Clinton does indeed have a big advantage in Nevada, then his chances start looking very bleak: He's at a disadvantage in the polls of all of the other states that could put him over the top. What's more, it's not really clear where he has his best chance \u2014 something reflected in Mr. Trump's unfocused pre-election push.\u201d\n\n-- A deep dive on the national mood: Fifteen of our reporters traveled the country talking to voters and report on \"deep anxiety \u2013 and some lingering traces of optimism\":\u00a0\u201cOnly eight years after millions of Americans poured into the streets in spontaneous, joyful celebration of the election of the nation\u2019s first black president, optimism seems to have been sucked out of the country\u2019s marrow, replaced by a heavy anxiety, a sense that things aren\u2019t right and can\u2019t easily be fixed.\"\n\n-- Early voting trends in FLORIDA\u00a0appear to (narrowly) favor Clinton: \u201cThe Democrats\u2019 lead of 7,280 ballots cast pales in comparison to their advantage of about 104,000 early and absentee votes four years ago, however the state\u2019s voter rolls have shifted significantly and neither Republicans nor Democrats can lay claim to having a clear advantage,\u201d Politico\u2019s Marc Caputo writes.\n\n\u201cI think it's trending well for HRC, but it's definitely a toss up state,\u201d says Democratic consultant Steve Schale, who helped lead Obama's efforts in the Sunshine State in 2008 and 2012. (Read his latest memo on the early vote.)\n\n-- Jon Ralston, the dean of the NEVADA press corps,\u00a0predicts a deep blue wave in the notoriously-hard-to-poll Silver State: \u201cTrump may have been here this weekend, believing in the polls that show him ahead or competitive here. But like Bruce Willis in \u2018The Sixth Sense\u2019 (spoiler alert), he does not realize he is dead. The Democratic early voting effort, which was much more difficult with a nominee so many Democrats don\u2019t like or trust, has been impressive \u2014 a valedictory statement from The Reid Machine. Yes, 2016 is not 2012. Hillary Clinton is not Barack Obama. Plenty of votes will be cast Tuesday. But: About two-thirds of the votes already have been banked.\u00a0If the past is prologue \u2026 The only real question, I think, is how deep the blue wave goes.\u201d\n\n-- The Supreme Court moved to allow an ARIZONA \u201cballot collection\u201d law barring organizers from picking up ballots and delivering them to election stations. The move is an eleventh-hour blow to Democrats, who argue that the ruling could disenfranchise thousands of minority voters. (CNN)\n\n-- Chris Christie canceled four NEW HAMPSHIRE stops on behalf of Trump yesterday, following the convictions of two former top aides for their role in the 2013 Bridgegate scandal. The New Jersey governor is doing an interview today with Charlie Rose to try cleaning up the mess. Imagine is Christie was the Republican nominee, and those convictions got handed down the Friday before the election?\u00a0(WMUR)\n\n-- Faithless elector alert: A WASHINGTON state Democratic elector said he is refusing to vote for Clinton even if she wins the popular vote, facing the potential of a $1,000 fine. He told the AP he \u201cdoesn\u2019t care.\u201d This could matter if the election is really close.\n\n-- Some are still Bernie or Bust: Sanders went to Iowa State University in Ames yesterday to lead a rally for Clinton. One of the warm-up speakers was Kaleb Vanfosson, the president of the Young Democratic Socialists group at the school. He was supposed to give a speech about the need for unity, but instead he took the stage and started talking about how \"terrible\" Hillary is.\u00a0\"She is so trapped in the world of the elite,\" the sophomore in political science said. \"She has completely lost grip of what it's like to be an average person.\" He added that there was no point in voting for the \"lesser of two evils.\" It took about a minute of this before a Clinton staffer escorted him off the stage. Here\u2019s the story from the student paper. And here\u2019s the video:\n\n-- Tim Kaine made headlines after suggesting that some inside the FBI are \u201cactively working\u201d to support Trump\u2019s campaign. From Ed O\u2019Keefe: In a Miami interview, Kaine called the FBI a \u201cleaky sieve\u201d and accused Jim Comey of breaking protocol by announcing his email investigation so close to an election. He also dismissed Trump ally Rudy Giuliani\u2019s decision to back off claims that he, Giuliani, had been given advance notice of the FBI's plans to possibly reopen the Clinton investigation. \u201cI don\u2019t think Giuliani\u2019s walk-back is credible,\u201d the Virginia senator said, referring to Giuliani\u2019s preemptive announcement that the FBI had a \u201cbig announcement\u201d to come. \u201cI think the FBI sadly has become like a leaky sieve,\u201d he added.\n\n-- New York Times, \u201cIf Clinton Moves to Oval Office, Aides\u2019 Baggage May Be Heavy,\u201d by Matt Flegenheimer and Mark Landler: \u201cIn the final sprint of her campaign, troubled by an F.B.I. inquiry and narrowing polls, [Clinton] has held tightly to a handful of advisers who have spent their careers protecting her interests, defending her reputation, and at times sullying it \u2014 and their own. And if she wins on Tuesday, the most telling test of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s transition back to power will arrive quickly: After a campaign season often defined by voters\u2019 weariness with and distrust of her, which old hands will \u2014 or should \u2014 follow her into the Oval Office? Almost no top adviser has been left untouched by the two central firestorms of Mrs. Clinton\u2019s candidacy: the inquiry into her use of a private email server \u2026 and the WikiLeaks hack of [campaign chairman John Podesta]. The unvarnished view of infighting in the stolen documents is unlikely to bother Mrs. Clinton much, friends say. The political wisdom of importing excess baggage to the executive branch is another matter.\"\n\n-- Boston Globe A1, \u201c9 moments that molded the campaign,\u201d by Matt Viser and Annie Linskey: \u201cWhen planning the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, Clinton campaign officials didn\u2019t initially include Michelle Obama as a featured speaker, according to a Democratic strategist familiar with the plans. \u2026 For Clinton\u2019s campaign, it made sense to put her on the rostrum on the tumultuous opening day \u2014 when Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren were both to speak. \u2018We thought it would be hard for Sanders\u2019 people to boo Michelle Obama,\u2019 said the person, who isn\u2019t authorized to talk about the first lady\u2019s deliberations.\u201d Another revelation: The Trump campaign was warned months in advance to be ready for Clinton\u2019s attack over Alicia Machado but did nothing.\n\n-- New Yorker, \u201cMeet Maya Harris, Hillary Clinton\u2019s Progressive Link,\u201d by Emily Greenhouse:\u00a0\u201cTo speak with those who have worked with Harris is to be bulldozed with superlatives. Mary Kay Henry, the president of the Service Employees International Union, who worked with Harris recently on the Democratic Party platform, told me that \u2018she lives her life on a moral crusade on all of those justice issues \u2026 She carries her peeps, our peeps, with her in everything she does.\u2019 Beyond policy, Harris seems to offer, in her very person, solutions to some of Clinton\u2019s image problems.\"\n\n-- The owners of the\u00a0National Enquirer reportedly paid to shield Trump from allegations of a former Playboy model who claims they had an affair, paying $150,000 for rights to her story before declining to publish it. From the Wall Street Journal\u2019s Joe Palazzolo, Michael Rothfeld and Lukas I. Alpert: \u201cThe tabloid-newspaper publisher reached an agreement in early August with Karen McDougal, the 1998 Playmate of the Year. American Media Inc., which owns the Enquirer, hasn\u2019t published anything about what she has told friends was a consensual romantic relationship she had with Mr. Trump in 2006. At the time, Mr. Trump was married to his current wife, Melania. Quashing stories that way is known in the tabloid world as \u2018catch and kill.\u2019 In a written statement, the company said it wasn\u2019t buying Ms. McDougal\u2019s story for $150,000, but rather two years\u2019 worth of her fitness columns and magazine covers as well as exclusive life rights to any relationship she has had with a then-married man.\u201d Trump and American Media Owner CEO David Pecker are longtime friends.\n\n-- Melania stumped alongside her husband in North Carolina, calling him\u00a0a \"compassionate, giving ... loving\" man, she said, who \"cares so deeply about this country.\"\n\n-- \u201cIn America\u2019s democratic showcase, the world sees a model of what not to do,\u201d by Griff Witte: \u201cIn the seaside cafes of Beirut, the whole thing looks \u2018like a bad joke.\u2019 To persecuted journalists in Burundi, it amounts to \u2018a total loss of dignity.\u2019 The government-scripted press of Beijing diagnoses \u2018an empire moving downhill.\u2019 And the spin doctors of the Kremlin see cause for pure and unambiguous delight. The U.S. presidential election \u2014 America\u2019s quadrennial chance to showcase for the world how democracy works in the most powerful nation on Earth \u2014 has become instead an object lesson in everything that ails a country long seen as a beacon of freedom and hope. People in small and distant countries who count on the U.S. to stand up for democratic values have been astonished to see essential components \u2026 trammeled. Long-standing allies have been left to wonder \u2026 whether the U.S. can be relied on when it counts. And even though the campaign still has days to go \u2014 with the outcome very much in doubt \u2014 the damage to American moral standing may already be done.\u201d\n\nQuote du jour: \u201cAmerica always spoke to Arab countries as if they had so much to learn,\u201d said a 27-year-old Beirut caf\u00e9 worker, who says he has been closely watching the election ever since he read about Trump\u2019s sexual assault boasts. \u201cAnd now we see their own democracy involves choosing between a woman from a dynasty and a man who says the system is manipulated. If that\u2019s democracy, then we don\u2019t want it.\u201d\n\n-- The New York Times\u2019 Farah Stockman and Nick Corasaniti explore how this loss of luster could affect the American brand: \u201cIn interviews, Americans who travel overseas and foreign observers say that tourists who once felt themselves the envy of the world now feel the sting of embarrassment. Businesses that once marketed their jeans and fleece jackets internationally as tiny pieces of the American dream are being advised to revamp their ad campaigns.\"\u00a0An Australian public relations consultant noted that state lawmakers in Sydney recently adopted a resolution \u2013 by unanimous consent \u2013 describing Trump as \"a revolting slug\u201d unfit for office.\n\n-- The idea that Tuesday will end our partisan rancor is a \u201cna\u00efve fantasy,\" writes\u00a0Frank Bruni:\u201cThere\u2019s no end here, just a punctuation mark, a measly comma between the rancor that has built until this point and the fury to come. And there\u2019s no way to un-see what all of us have seen over these last 18 months, to bottle up what has been un-bottled. Election Day will redeem and settle nothing, not this time around. Whether balloons fall on [Clinton] or [Trump], there will be bolder divisions in America than there were at the start of it all and even less faith in the country\u2019s most important institutions \u2026 Even putting Trump\u2019s angry troops aside, it feels as if we\u2019re coming out of this election with four parties: the Paul Ryan Republicans, the Freedom Caucus, the establishment Democrats and the Elizabeth Warren/Bernie Sanders brigade \u2026 Meet the new paralysis, same as the old paralysis. Potentially, worse. From elections past, I don\u2019t recognize this terrain. How can I assume that it\u2019s navigable?\u201d\n\n-- \u201cIf [Trump] loses, the party faces a daunting reconstruction challenge,\u201d says conservative columnist Peter Wehner, who served in the Bush and Reagan administrations: \u201cPolicies that promote economic growth, social mobility and greater opportunity are important. But in some respects the party\u2019s stance [here] is a secondary priority. Republicans need to wrestle with more fundamental questions first: Will their party choose as its leaders people who respect democratic institutions and traditions, or not; who conceive of America as a welcoming society or as one that is racially and religiously closed \u2026 who abhor ignorance or embrace it? In a post-Trump world, Republicans need to ask themselves if their party will be characterized by its aspirations or its resentments. Can it make its own inner peace with living in an increasingly diverse and nonwhite America? Does it conceive of its role as tamping down or inflaming ugly passions? Does it believe in a just social order or not? The next few months will tell us a lot about whether Mr. Trump and Trumpism were an anomaly or are now the new norm of the party that Lincoln helped create.\"\n\n-- \u201cWhen historians write about this bizarre, ugly and dispiriting campaign \u2026 the epic dark saga will unfold this way: A man, filled with fear and insecurity, created a hatemongering character and followed it out the window. And a woman, filled with fear and insecurity, hunkered down and repeated bad patterns rather than reimagining herself in an open, bold way,\u201d Maureen Dowd writes. \u201cBefore he jumped into the presidential race, Trump was seen as bombastic, vulgar, a bit of a buffoon and a cave man, but [also] \u2018a cheeky brio.\u2019 He was not regarded as a bigot or demagogue. He was seen as a playboy, not a predator \u2026 But he created another character for the Republican primaries, playing to the feral instincts of angry voters, encouraging violence at his rallies, hatred toward journalists and disrespect for democracy itself. \u2018He\u2019s so used to playing a role in different areas of his life,\u2019 said [TV personality] Donny Deutsch \u2026 \u2018He saw the crowd\u2019s adulation and it drove him. He started to get the biggest cheers for saying the most offensive things.\u2019\u201d\n\n-- The New Yorker\u2019s Jeffrey Toobin dubbed this election \u201cClinton investigation mania, part two\u201d: \u201cBill Clinton\u2019s Presidency was defined, for the most part, by criminal and congressional investigations,\u201d he writes. \u201cThe subjects of those probes sound like entries in a nineteen-nineties time capsule: Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate \u2026 It may be that Republicans spent so much time in pursuit of Bill Clinton\u2019s scalp because things were mostly going well otherwise. The economy boomed, and the nation was at peace. So Congress took a vacation from its responsibilities to investigate a decade-old Arkansas land deal in which the Clintons lost money. But real dangers abound in the unstable world of today. The economy is only tenuously prosperous. And a warming planet, notwithstanding the lack of interest among debate moderators, threatens apocalyptic change. A politics based on pursuit and accusation, rather than on reason and compromise, will address none of these problems. And the prospect of four years of governance that resemble the last days of this campaign is one that would drive anyone to drink.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cAverting the worst starts with electing Hillary Clinton,\u201d says the New York Times\u2019 Editorial Board. \u201cFor many voters that will mean defying Republican efforts to jam the electoral machinery through lies, legal obstructions and the threat of violence. We hope the voters hold out, however intimidating the process and long the lines. For Americans who may feel unmoved or unwilling to vote for Mrs. Clinton, here is a question from the future: In 2016 we were closer than ever to electing an ignorant and reckless tyrant \u2014 what did you do to stop him? There\u2019s no sense complaining anymore. The hurricane is three days from landfall. The urgent thing now is to avert the worst, minimize the damage, save the foundations, clear the mess.\u201d\n\n-- \"The Wall Street Journal hasn\u2019t endorsed a presidential candidate since 1928, and if we didn\u2019t endorse Ronald Reagan we aren\u2019t about to revive the practice for Mrs. Clinton or Mr. Trump,\"\u00a0the Journal\u2019s board declares. \u201cA broken Washington needs to be shaken up and refocused on the public good, and who better to do it than an outsider beholden to neither political party? If only that reform possibility didn\u2019t arrive as a flawed personality who has few convictions and knows little about the world.\u201d\n\n-- South Korean prosecutors arrested two former aides of President Park Geun-hye on Sunday, widening an investigation into the bizarre \u201cshadow president\u201d scandal that has stoked outrage across the country. On Saturday, tens of thousands of people gathered in the capital to demand she step down. (AP)\n\n-- A Kurdish-led, U.S. backed force in Syria launched an offensive to retake control of Raqqa, seeking to drive out Islamic State militants from their northeastern stronghold. The operation with the U.S.-supported military effort to seize the Mosul from ISIS militants, Hugh Naylor writes. And the impending assault represents an \u201cintensified international effort\u201d to increase pressure on the extremist group as it loses control of territory in the countries.\n\n-- As Chicago battles its highest rate of homicides in nearly 20 years, police are solving fewer cases than they have in decades.\u00a0Officers today clear just 26 percent of cases \u2013 a drastic reduction from years such as 1991, where levels averaged 80 percent. (Kimbriell\u00a0Kelly, Wesley Lowery and Steven Rich)\n\n-- A South Carolina real estate agent accused of kidnapping a woman and keeping her chained up by the neck \u201clike a dog\u201d inside a storage container may be responsible for the deaths of at least seven people, authorities said. Police said they discovered at least one body on the man\u2019s property, and he confessed to a string of other homicides. The gruesome revelations come as a stark contrast to the man\u2019s professional image \u2013 appearing to be a successful realtor who ran his own firm upstate. (Amy B Wang)\n\n-- Two men in D.C. were arrested for allegedly spray painting the Trump Hotel and the FBI building on Saturday. Police said the incidences occurred during the Million Mask March demonstration. Both men were charged with defacing government property and resisting arrest. (Joe Heim)\n\n-- Great profile --> \u201cFounding Fervor,\u201d by Kevin Sullivan: \u00a0\u201cMore than 250 people, mostly conservative Christians, clap and whoop as [KrisAnne] Hall takes the stage in the ballroom of a suburban Minnesota hotel \u2026 Hall, a radio host, former Florida prosecutor and Army veteran, tells the crowd that the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights group that tracks extremism, has included her on its list of 998 anti-government groups in the U.S. She just loves that. Hall, 47, started firing up rage at the federal government six years ago, driving around the southeast in her old Saturn car \u2026 [Now] in this era of [Trump], her message fits the moment, and her popularity has exploded. She is a chief circuit rider for liberty, spending more than 260 days a year preaching against federal government overreach.\u00a0 She says those who disagree with her reading of history are either ignorant of the founders\u2019 intentions or \u2018federal supremacists\u2019 who ignore the Constitution. \u2018The problem with her approach is that it ignores 240 years of history,\u2019 said Georgetown professor David Cole.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cBig government is the new West Coast craze,\u201d by Jim Tankersley: \u201cVoters up and down the West Coast are quietly poised to extend a massive economic experiment this Election Day, probing the limits of how much states can soak the big guys to help the little guys. Their efforts \u2014 in three of the hottest state economies in the country \u2014 defy decades of conservative arguments about cutting taxes to spur economic growth. The new West Coast Model is higher taxes on the rich, higher spending by the state and wide-scale efforts to lift the working poor. \u2026 It is on the ballot in three states: Californians are set to essentially make permanent an income tax surcharge on millionaires in order to fund education. Washington voters appear likely to raise their minimum wage statewide to $13.25 an hour \u2026 In Oregon, it will be a down-to-the-wire battle to see if voters will bolster their state budget by taxing large corporations. Advocates are already planning how to export them to the rest of the country.\u201d\n\n-- \u201cIslamic State tunnels below Mosul are a hidden and deadly danger,\u201d by William Booth and Aaso Ameen Shwan \u201c\u2019They\u2019re everywhere,\u2019 said the Iraqi intelligence officer, sweeping his arm from this ancient Christian village toward the horizon. The Iraqi captain was searching for tunnels dug by Islamic State fighters. The officer stomped on the ground. \u2018Here. We found one, then three, now six. Right here.\u2019 \u2026 Villages recaptured from ISIS over the past three weeks \u2026 have been honeycombed with tunnels, many of them booby-trapped. In the past three days, commanders say Iraqi forces have faced the hardest fighting of the offensive as they entered Mosul, made worse by extensive tunnels that are allowing ISIS fighters to appear seemingly out of nowhere, attack, then retreat to the hidden bunkers. An Iraqi armored commander who drove his Abrams tank into eastern Mosul recalled seeing dozens of fighters scrambling on the street in front of his guns. \u2018Then they disappeared,\u2019 he said. Into the ground. \u2018It\u2019s like we are fighting two wars in two cities,\u2019 said Col. Falah Al-Obaidi of the Iraqi counterterror forces. \u2018There\u2019s the war on the streets and there is a whole city underground where they are hiding.\u2019\"\n\n-- \u201cSenate majority may hinge on NEVADA candidates unable to break through noise,\u201d by Paul Kane: \u201cThe battle for the Senate might well come down to a contest in which neither candidate has broken through the much-louder noise of other political fights. For months, U.S. Rep. Joseph J. Heck and former state attorney general Catherine Cortez Masto have slugged it out in the most expensive Senate race in this state\u2019s history, locked in a tight contest that gives Republicans a chance to steal a Democratic crown jewel: the seat of Senate Minority Leader [Harry Reid]. A Heck victory would make the tenuous path for Republicans to hold the Senate majority easier to navigate. Democrats need four seats to capture the majority if [Clinton] \u2026 wins the White House. Yet despite those high stakes, the Senate race here has often felt like an undercard boxing match on the Las Vegas Strip as everyone awaits the main event between the presidential candidates, Clinton and [Trump], who have campaigned and spent heavily in this key swing state.\u201d\n\nNEWS YOU CAN USE IF YOU LIVE IN D.C.:\n\n-- The Capital Weather Gang forecasts another gorgeous fall day ahead: \u201cOur spectacular weekend weather continues today. You\u2019ll want to get out and enjoy every minute you can, before the sun sets in the District at 5:02 p.m.! Morning temperatures rise through the 50s and, by afternoon, it doesn\u2019t feel much like November, as highs climb to around 65-70.\u201d\n\nHere's the final \"Saturday Night Live\" cold open before the election, with Cecily Strong as Erin Burnett:\n\nIt's been a long election season, but there were some great moments; here are a few of our favorites:\n\nClinton quickly ended her rally in Florida when it began pouring rain:\n\nThe Clinton campaign released an 8-minute \"mini documentary\" about her campaign:\n\nIn Denver, Trump said he \"doesn't need\" celebrity supporters like Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z:\n\nIn light of Trump, Bill Maher said maybe he was too tough on George W. Bush and Mitt Romney:\n\nNH1 asked Elizabeth Warren what she thought about a possible 2018 race with Red Sox legend Curt Schilling:", "257": "The overflow crowds showing up to hear Bernie Sanders these days are a testament not only to his current popularity and the campaign\u2019s social-media savvy but also to the promotional abilities of an alchemy of like-minded interests: progressive activists, labor unions and even Sarah Silverman.\n\nThe comedian took to Twitter to let her nearly 6.7\u00a0million followers know she would be at a rally for the Democratic presidential hopeful here Monday. That event drew an estimated 27,500 people \u2014 about five times as large as any crowd that has turned out for Democratic front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton.\n\n\u201cBernie always seems to be on the right side of history,\u201d Silverman told the boisterous audience at the Los Angeles Memorial Sports Arena, noting that the 73-year-old was a civil rights activist in the 1960s, supported gay rights in the 1980s and strongly opposed the Iraq war before most other Americans.\n\n[To his old socialist allies, Sanders has sold out]\n\nAll told, Sanders has attracted more than 100,000 people to his rallies in recent weeks, riding a wave of Facebook shares, retweets and old-fashioned word-of-mouth to become by far the biggest draw on the campaign trail.\n\nSuch turnout is no guarantee that Sanders will perform well in the crucial early-nominating states \u2014 fellow Vermonter Howard Dean preached to similarly large and frenzied audiences in mostly liberal enclaves in 2003, only to collapse as the Iowa caucuses approached.\n\nBut it is drawing energy and attention away from Clinton \u2014 whose aides peg her largest crowd to date at 5,500 \u2014 and exposing a lack of enthusiasm for her candidacy among some facets of the Democratic Party. And it is creating a network of small-scale donors and volunteers that could provide Sanders with the resources he will need to compete with the former secretary of state and first lady in the weeks and months ahead.\n\nRoughly 28,000 people showed up for a recent Sanders rally in Portland, Ore. The self-described democratic socialist drew 15,000 in Seattle; 11,000 in Phoenix; 10,000 in Madison, Wis.; 8,000 in Dallas; and 4,500 in New Orleans.\n\n[The Sanders predicament: Where do you fit all those people?]\n\nThis weekend, Sanders will host a couple of town hall meetings in Iowa and attend events with other candidates. His campaign has not yet said where his next large-scale rally will be.\n\nIn Los Angeles, Sanders\u2019s campaign estimated that 27,500 people were jammed inside and outside the 16,000-seat arena \u2014 a figure impossible to independently verify. Nearly every seat appeared to be taken, and the arena floor was packed. Outside, thousands more watched the rally on large screens.\n\nThe throngs were greeted by Dante Harris, the leader of a flight attendants union local that had helped promote the rally.\n\n\u201cDid all of you make the trip out here on a Monday night because everything is going well for you and your family?\u201d he asked.\n\nHarris nodded and shouted back. \u201cWorkers\u2019 lives matter! .\u2009.\u2009. Black lives matter! .\u2009.\u2009. The truth matters!\u201d Struggling to be heard over the ensuing ovation, he said, \u201cWe can build a movement with Bernie!\u201d\n\nThe audience was noticeably more diverse than those at recent Sanders rallies in Portland, Seattle and other majority-white cities. Los Angeles is majority-minority, with about 44\u00a0percent of its population Latino.\n\n[Sanders needs to court black voters. Now he is.]\n\nThere were young hipsters and graying hippies. Some wore black T-shirts with red hammers and sickles; others wore black T-shirts that read \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d They sang along as the loudspeakers blasted songs by Willie Nelson, Tracy Chapman and Neil Young. One man carried a handmade sign that said \u201cBernie: Our Only Hope for Change.\u201d\n\nAbout a week before each Sanders rally, his campaign sets up a Web page announcing the location and blasts out an e-mail to\u00a0supporters in that geographic area, asking them to RSVP. There are no paid advertisements.\n\nThe events are promoted on Facebook, with the campaign enlisting progressive groups and other \u201cfriends and allies\u201d to help spread the word, said national field director Phil Fiermonte. From there, things tend to take on a life of their own.\n\nLike Harris, climate-change activist Joe Galliani got a speaking slot in Los Angeles because his union had spread the word about the rally. He earned some of the loudest cheers as he denounced construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline and touted the benefits of solar roofs.\n\nThen there was Maria Barrera, the 31-year-old leader of the Coalition for Humane Immigrant Rights of Los Angeles, who tearfully noted that Congress has not enacted comprehensive immigration reforms since the 1980s. \u201cFor the last 25 years, families have been separated,\u201d Barrera said.\n\n[Activists drove Sanders from a stage, 15,000 people awaited him at the next]\n\nThe turnout and enthusiasm have been similar at Sanders events across the country.\n\nFor the Portland rally, a local group lobbying for a $15-per-hour minimum wage in the city \u2014 a cause Sanders supports nationally \u2014 drove a sizable contingent of people to the event. In addition, the Oregon Democratic Party sent an e-mail to people in its database letting them know about the event (with the disclaimer that the party is not taking sides in the presidential primary).\n\nLocal Democrats who attended the rally said it appeared to draw lots of newcomers to party politics.\n\n\u201cI hardly ever go to these events without running into friends, and I didn\u2019t see many people I knew,\u201d said Sue Hagmeier, the communications officer for the Democratic Party in Multnomah County, which includes Portland.\n\nHagmeier said she probably received 15 to 20 digital notifications in advance of the event, counting forwarded e-mails and Facebook posts. Sanders supporters also posted fliers on telephone poles and promoted the event by \u201cchalking the sidewalks,\u201d a tradition in a city known for big political rallies. (In 2008, an estimated 75,000 people came to see then-Sen. Barack Obama on the banks of the Willamette River as he closed in on the Democratic presidential nomination.)\n\nSanders is striving to harness the energy to help him in states such as Iowa and New Hampshire, where his crowds have been much smaller but still relatively robust. Volunteers hand out donation envelopes to rally attendees and carefully take down their contact information so they can be solicited for money later.\n\nIn Los Angeles, anyone who gave on the spot received a Sanders campaign T-shirt. Speakers asked the crowd to text \u201cBernie\u201d to a five-digit number. In reply, they would receive text messages seeking money and volunteer time.\n\nWhen Sanders came onstage, the cheers were deafening. His voice hoarse, the senator told the crowd, \u201cThis campaign is not a billionaire-funded campaign \u2014 it is a people-funded campaign.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is no president who will fight harder to end institutional racism,\u201d he said. \u201cOr for a higher minimum wage. Or for paid parental leave. Or for at least two weeks of paid vacation. .\u2009.\u2009. Whenever we stand together, when we do not allow them to divide us up by the color of our skin or our sexual orientation, by whether a man or a woman is born in America or born somewhere else, whenever we stand together, there is nothing, nothing, nothing we cannot accomplish.\u201d\n\nMike Jelf, 69, said he spent the day before the rally leafleting for the campaign in nearby Torrance. He brought his Saint Bernard, Munro, to the arena, wearing a shirt that said \u201cSaints for Sanders.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to see a country that\u2019s returned to the people, rather than a plutocratic oligarchy,\u201d Jelf said. \u201cI would like to have a planet that\u2019s habitable for future generations.\u201d\n\nJean-Luc St. Pierre, 19, said he flew from Maryland to attend the rally. He started a \u201cBaltimore for Bernie\u201d Facebook group targeting people in the home town of former Maryland governor Martin O\u2019Malley, another Democratic presidential candidate.\n\nGloria Rios, from Eagle Rock, Calif., said she joined Sanders\u2019s e-mail list a month ago. \u201cI feel very strongly about him,\u201d she said, adding that she has concerns about Clinton.\n\nWhat are those concerns? She paused. For a really long time.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s \u2014 too much conflict around her,\u201d Rios said. \u201cI\u2019m the kind of person who feels that what you say and do has to match up.\u201d\n\nSanders, she added, \u201cresonates more closely to me.\u201d\n\nAfter the rally, the Sanders campaign tweeted a photo showing some of the thousands who had watched from outside the arena.\n\n\u201cApologies to the large crowds who couldn\u2019t fit indoors at tonight\u2019s rally,\u201d the tweet said. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have to get bigger venues!\u201d", "258": "in World \u2014 by Mirza Yawar Baig \u2014 November 10, 2016 \nWhew! Finally, the charade is over. Donald Trump is now the President of the United States of America. What does that mean? It means that Simpsons prediction came true: https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/2146815/the-simpsons-correctly-predicted-a-donald-trump-presidency-16-years-ago-in-episode-set-in-the-near-future/ \nSo now you know who to refer to for accurate predictions about the future. Goodbye Tarot cards, et al. In 1995 I recall reading a survey which concluded that America was not likely to be ready for a woman president for the next twenty years. Twenty-one years later, it looks like that prediction was true. Given that women in America to this day are paid 80% of what men are paid, it is not surprising that Americans find it tough to visualize a woman in the White House in any place other than the President\u2019s bed. \nSo, what does Trump mean for America, for American Muslims, for Muslims worldwide, for non-whites in America and globally? I am asking this rhetorical question as I see all kinds of doomsday predictions flying around. I apologize for taking a different view. I see the Trump presidency as an opportunity for those who believe in the opposite of everything that Donald Trump promoted in his campaign to put their actions where their mouths are and show that they are as willing to stand up for what they believe in as he was. \nWhat does Trump mean for America? I hope he will be the best thing that happened to America ever. I hope that he can truly make \u2018America Great Again\u2019. I say that because though I am not American (should I say, \u2018Thank God?\u2019), I am one who believes that a truly \u2018Great America\u2019, can make this world great. The world truly needs to change. We need someone to lead the way to make the world compassionate, caring, fighting against injustice, corruption and poverty; disease and ignorance. Which nation is better suited to lead that fight? America has the resources, the intelligence, the education and the leadership ability which I hope it chooses to exercise. Trump won on the anti-establishment platform. I support that fully. The establishment has shown that what it can do is to fail spectacularly. The economy crashed and Obama rewarded those who crashed it. People were and are homeless when there are empty homes on foreclosed loans enough for every American to have two homes, not only one. Yet they are on the streets. I hope Trump can put Americans back in their own homes. \nBush father and son, started never ending wars. Obama continued them adding his own flavor to it of drone strikes \u2013 using technology to create bug splats (the arrogance is incredible) \u2013 thereby escalating the global threat level that comes from driving people to desperation. Obama\u2019s dabbling (what else to call it?) in Middle Eastern politics resulted in continuing the misery for people of Afghanistan and Iraq and new misery for people of Syria and by inference for the rest of the world. And to top it all ISIS came into being because of all of the above. The credit can be shared by all of them. So, Trump standing against the establishment means that he is against all of this. I sincerely hope so. \nAll the jingoism that he rode on will get tempered when it comes to facing reality. It is easy to talk about kicking out the Mexicans and so on. But the day he does that, reality will dawn on him and his cohorts like it did on those who voted Pro-Brexit; that the rich need the poor to survive while the poor don\u2019t need the rich. When nice white Americans get to pay $3 per potato, they will realize the value of cheap labor. Meanwhile some contractor will get the contract to build the Wall, which he will do from the Mexican side, no doubt as otherwise his margin will not make it worthwhile. So also, the wonderful idea to outlaw the H-1 visa. I don\u2019t think it will take very long for Trump and his gang to realize that there is a reason there are blond jokes. And that Indians are not blond. Go figure that. \nThe good news is that Trump made public what was private \u2013 racism, misogyny in a country that never stops \u2018trumpeting\u2019 about women\u2019s equality, support for genocide, wars and weapons sales, the evils of unbridled capitalism, locker-room conversations which indicate attitudes \u2013 have all come out of the closet and locker-room. Now it is up to those who like to say that they believe in the opposite of all these things, to get off their backsides and bring about change. They can no longer live the lives of pretense and lies that they had become used to, saying, \u2018It is not happening here.\u2019 Trump proved that it is happening and has trumpeted it from the top of Trump tower. Sorry for so much bad punning in one breath. But there you go. \nAs for Muslims and Trump, believe me Trump is far better than what Muslims have seen in the past. He is far better than what we have today. Take Sisi, the Oily royals who are personal friends of every weapons dealer, the Paki leadership and I can think of several more and Trump begins to look like a choir boy. What will he do that is not already happening? Frankly I don\u2019t know and don\u2019t care to speculate because the prime movers behind Muslim affairs and how they are, are Muslims themselves. Our leadership or more correctly its spectacular failure. Ordinary citizens pay the price, but what\u2019s new about that? The fact remains that until we sort that out and do something about taking charge of our destiny, we must remain satisfied with others writing the script we are compelled to live by. Play endings depend on the script, not on the players. \nIndia is a classic example where a so-called minority of 200 million is kicked around like a football and used at will by every mercenary politician for his own ends. But Indian Muslims seem to be satisfied with that, so who is anyone else to complain. If you disagree and tell me that they are not satisfied, then I must ask you what it is that prevents them from doing what is glaringly obvious; get their act together, change their leaders and write their own script. 200 million is not a minority. It is a nation. But only if it chooses to be. Same story for Muslims globally. No point in blaming Trump or looking up to him to find solutions. It is our problem and we must solve it, so let us start doing that. \nTwo other points: what about wars, global warming and such issues? Well, when you have a nation that lives on perpetual warfare and is supported in that by all the other major industrial nations who either manufacture and sell weapons or buy them, how can you pin it all on Trump? If weapons are made and sold, there will be wars. Wars will happen if they continue to make profits for those who run them. That people die is incidental. Those at the top who laugh all the way to the bank, don\u2019t. Those that do, don\u2019t count. They are \u2018collateral\u2019, who are necessary to prove the efficacy of the weapons that were used to vaporize them. If it wasn\u2019t for the bugs who splatted, how would you assess the drones or their operators? The fact that the bugs were innocent or that they had families and so on; well, bugs are bugs. And that\u2019s all that there is to it. \nGlobal warming? America decided on that when it chose Bush instead of Al Gore. For a minute I thought that was because they got confused because his name is Al Gore like Al Ghurair. But then I realized that it was because he had a terminal problem; he had a brain. See his famous movie, An Inconvenient Truth, and you will see what I mean. https://www.algore.com/library/an-inconvenient-truth-dvd If you do nothing else, buy this and see it. At least you will know why you died. Since you chose that, especially Americans, I believe it is only fair that you understand what you did. With Trump, that came out in the open, so get used to summer all year long. You won\u2019t need to go to the French Riviera for a tan. You can get it at home. That is not inconvenient. \nAdd to this the effect ofunending wars, refugee movement, changing cultures, security nightmares coming true, widening gap between the rich and the poor, global poverty and hunger, preventable disease which is not prevented because there\u2019s no profit in it \u2013 when I think about all this and Trump\u2019s election, Nero comes to mind. Renewing our link with tradition. Let us dance to the tune. What\u2019s the use of fiddling otherwise? \nFinal question that everyone is asking, \u2018How safe is it to have someone like Trump with his finger on the nuclear button?\u2019 \nMy answer is, \u2018The one who actually pressed that button was as different from Trump as could be. Yet he did it.\u2019 Let me leave you to figure out the rest. \nMeanwhile it is midnight where I live, far away from Trump and America and time to go to bed. Truly it is said that there is solace in sleep. So, good night, world. Sleep well.

With Congress taking up the deal and expected to vote on it sometime in September, the hearing underscored the deep resistance the Obama administration faces from both parties.\n\n\"From my perspective, Mr. Secretary, I'm sorry ... I believe you've been fleeced,\" Committee Chairman Bob Corker, R-Tenn., told Kerry, claiming the agreement paves the path for Iran to eventually develop a nuclear bomb.\n\nCritics repeatedly suggested the Obama administration's negotiating team gave in to pressure from the Iranians on key points. They question whether sanctions indeed can be reinstated once they're lifted; whether Iran might be able to stall international inspectors; and whether Iran might be closer to a weapon once the deal expires.\n\nSen. James Risch, R-Idaho, said: \"You guys have been bamboozled.\"\n\nKerry, though, vigorously defended the agreement, calling it \"fantasy, plain and simple,\" to think the United States failed to hold out for a better deal at the bargaining table.\n\n\"Let me underscore, the alternative to the deal we've reached isn't what I've seen some ads on TV suggesting disingenuously,\" he told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.\u00a0\"It isn't a quote better deal, some sort of unicorn arrangement involving Iran's complete capitulation.\"\n\nEnergy Secretary Ernest Moniz also said the deal is not \"built on trust.\"\n\nSome lawmakers tried to play referee when the hearing got heated. Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., said the remarks from Corker and Risch were \"disrespectful and insulting.\"\n\n\"If you were bamboozled, the world has been bamboozled -- that's ridiculous,\" Boxer told Kerry.\n\nKerry still had to contend with skeptical Democrats, notably Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who questioned whether the language in the deal is tough enough and like Corker said the deal aids Iran in building an \"industrial-scale\" nuclear program.\n\nKerry earlier warned that Iran will not come back to the negotiating table to pursue a new deal, voicing frustration that: \"We've got 535 secretaries of state.\"\n\nThe hearing comes as lawmakers raise new concerns about alleged secret \"side deals\" struck with Tehran over its nuclear program.\n\nSen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Rep. Mike Pompeo, R-Kan., first brought attention to them Tuesday, saying they learned from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) that there were two \"side deals\" between Iran and the IAEA.\n\nAccording to the lawmakers, one agreement covers inspection of the Parchin military complex, and the other concerns potential military aspects of Iran's nuclear program. On the former, they said, Iran would be able to strike a separate arrangement with the IAEA concerning inspections at Parchin.\n\nHouse Speaker John Boehner and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell joined Cotton and Pompeo in sending a letter to President Obama on Wednesday requesting that the agreements be made available to Congress so that they can be reviewed.\n\n\"We request you transmit these two side agreements to Congress immediately so we may perform our duty to assess the many important questions related to the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action],\" the letter says.\n\nNational Security Adviser Susan Rice, while defending the overall nuclear agreement, appeared to acknowledge the existence of the side deals on Wednesday. She said the matter of the Iran nuclear program's \"possible military dimensions\" (PMD) has long been an issue between Iran and the IAEA. She said they \"negotiated and concluded an agreement to deal with this issue of PMD, which was one of the major sticking points in our dealings.\"\n\nShe added: \"These documents are not public, but nonetheless, we have been briefed on those documents, we know their contents, we're satisfied with them and we will share the contents of those briefings in full in a classified session with the Congress. So there's nothing in that regard that we know that they won't know.\"\n\nPompeo also asked Kerry about the secret deals in a briefing Wednesday and said afterwards that Kerry \"confirmed that there were in fact side deals and himself had not seen the agreement.\"\n\n\"I was incredibly surprised to learn there were components of the deal that Congress was not going to be privy to,\" Pompeo said, adding that he had expected that American negotiators would have demanded to see the side deals being cut.\n\nKerry said after Thursday's hearing, though, \"there are no side deals.\"\n\nThe letter to Obama expressed concern that Congress was being kept in the dark.\n\n\"Most troubling, Iran and the IAEA reached agreement to resolve issues related to research at Parchin, but Congress will not have the ability to review this agreement, nor will we know the results of the IAEA's assessment until December 15,\" the letter says.\n\nIt goes on to request access to the side deals so that Congress can effectively review the deal as a whole:\n\n\"Failure to produce these two side agreements leaves Congress blind on critical information regarding Iran's potential path to being a nuclear power and will have detrimental consequences for the ability of members to assess the JCPOA,\" the letter says.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.", "260": "Hillary Clinton told a joke. Speaking to a roomful of Goldman Sachs bankers in June 2013, Clinton said that Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein could leave the Wall Street firm that\u2019s made him a billionaire to start a soup kitchen:\n\nThis exchange was written down by Clinton\u2019s aides as they gathered information on what parts of her paid Wall Street speeches could prove damaging should they leak to the press. Her team filed it under the heading, \"AWKWARD.\"\n\nThis \"AWKWARD\" quote and hundreds of other previously hidden nuggets about Clinton have spilled out into public view recently. Over the last two weeks, Julian Assange\u2019s whistleblower platform WikiLeaks has published about 20,000 pages of emails illegally stolen from John Podesta, Clinton\u2019s campaign chair.\n\nThe strangest thing about the ensuing uproar is that none of the Podesta emails has so far actually broken any fresh scandals about the woman on track to be the next president. Instead, they\u2019ve mostly revealed an underbelly of ugliness to the multiple Clinton controversies that we\u2019ve already known about: the questionable relationship between the Clinton Foundation and its donors, Clinton\u2019s ease with powerful interests on Wall Street, her ties to wealthy campaign contributors.\n\nThe Goldman soup kitchen joke is a perfect example. If there\u2019s one thing to really get mad about here, it\u2019s something we\u2019ve known for years \u2014 that Clinton took millions from big Wall Street banks right before running for president. Seeing her and Wall Street titans share a laugh about helping the hungry might turn your stomach, but the most important question \u2014 was it wrong for Clinton to take big checks from Goldman right before running? \u2014 is in no way new. (Clinton\u2019s campaign refused to comment on individual emails, instead blaming the Russians for hacking the emails and providing them to WikiLeaks.)\n\nThis is, from what we\u2019ve seen so far, the real story of WikiLeaks\u2019 Podesta emails. Yes, they have not found any major \"bombshells.\" No, they\u2019re not going to sink Clinton\u2019s campaign. But by filling in the storylines that have long dogged her campaign with new and vivid detail, we are getting our clearest picture yet of how the sausage \u2014 or, if you prefer, the creamy risotto \u2014 gets made in Clinton-world.\n\nIt can be an ugly sight.\n\nI\u2019ve now read hundreds of the Podesta emails, as well as upward of 60 stories from across left-wing, mainstream, and conservative media outlets about what they entail.\n\nI should stress that what I\u2019ve found is far from all bad. Dozens of these emails show Clinton\u2019s team genuinely striving to discover the correct position on an issue. Many of them show real, determined efforts to find the right solution to some public policy crisis. In general, especially compared to the vicious infighting that characterized her 2008 presidential run, you come away from the Podesta emails thinking that Clinton has assembled an admiringly loyal group of aides that believes in the candidate and the mission of the campaign. There\u2019s some backbiting, but you could imagine far, far worse.\n\nThen there\u2019s the other stuff \u2014 the emails Podesta presumably wish never leaked. To help make sense of what we\u2019ve learned, I\u2019ve broken out the interesting new bits into what I think can be more-or-less characterized as four distinct categories:\n\nVox reached out to the Clinton campaign for comment, and spokesperson Glen Caplin replied that they are \"still not authenticating any individual emails.\" The campaign also referred foundation-related questions to the foundation itself, and referenced several times that the leaks were tied to a \"Russian attempt to influence our election.\" As it has to other reporters, the Clinton campaign did not dispute the accuracy of any of the individual emails.\n\nWe should be clear that these Podesta email leaks have nothing to do with the multiple other \"Clinton email\" scandals percolating over the past few years. So they aren\u2019t, as some news outlets have incorrectly reported, related to the FBI investigation into Clinton\u2019s private server or allegations that she went around transparency laws.\n\nInstead, since these emails emerge from the private account of Clinton\u2019s campaign chair, they tend to tell us far more about candidate Clinton than they do about Secretary of State Clinton.\n\nThere is, however, one exception to that general rule: the Clinton Foundation.\n\nSince the campaign began, the Clinton Foundation has been at the center of an intense debate. The most extreme critics, like Donald Trump, have alleged that Clinton used the state department to transactionally reward the charity\u2019s donors (there\u2019s no evidence for that). Meanwhile, the campaign and foundation have fallen back on one consistent defense \u2014 that there\u2019s been no proof of a quid pro quo between donor and foundation.\n\nThe Clinton Foundation really did do inarguably life-saving work. But good government experts have argued that the Clintons accepted private donations in a way that they should have known would have created dangerous conflicts of interest. This more nuanced attack faults the Clinton Foundation for dangerously blurring the distinction between private and public.\n\nThe Podesta leaks back up that story.\n\nOne way it does so is by uncovering a private audit conducted by a widely-respected New York City law firm. The review concluded that the Clinton Foundation\u2019s board had failed to oversee potential conflicts of interest, and that some donors expected \"quid pro quo benefits.\" \"Interviewees reported conflicts of those raising funds or donors, some of whom may have an expectation of quid pro quo benefits in return for gift,\" the audit found.\n\nIt\u2019s not clear they received them. but either way the audit is a striking confirmation that even the attorneys hired by Clinton recognized the danger in the relationship between donor and foundation.\n\nThen there\u2019s another disclosure emerging from the Podesta emails: that Qatari officials sought to present Bill Clinton with a $1 million gift on his birthday on during his wife\u2019s tenure as secretary of state. As the New York Times noted, this revelation suggests that foreign governments were able to gain an audience with Bill Clinton in exchange for a check. (The Times couldn\u2019t confirm if the $1 million check was ever cashed.)\n\nThe last revelation in the leaks about the foundation may also be the most unusual: Chelsea Clinton apparently was running around raising the alarm bell over possible conflicts of interest, suggesting the Clintons themselves were aware of the potential problems. (Politico\u2019s Kenneth Vogel has a detailed blow-by-blow of Chelsea\u2019s concerns over the overlapping roles of a consulting firm named Teneo.)\n\nNothing here represents a major revelation. If you weren\u2019t bothered by the Clinton Foundation before, this probably isn\u2019t going to trouble you. But if you were, having an audit and Chelsea Clinton share your fears will fuel the sense that something suspicious was afoot here.\n\nOver the course of the election, Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders leveled a similar critique of Clinton: that she\u2019s too wedded to the \"political establishment.\"\n\nFor Sanders, that usually meant that Clinton didn\u2019t have the independence to challenge powerful actors on Wall Street and in Washington, DC. Trump has used similar rhetoric, going after \"Crooked\" Clinton for her big dollar campaign contributors.\n\nWhatever you think of the merits of those attacks, it\u2019s clear that the majority of the American people think it\u2019s correct, at least in broad strokes. Seven in 10 voters consider Clinton part of the establishment. Just 30 percent trust her to take on special interests.\n\nIt\u2019s an impression that the Podesta emails only deepen \u2014 even if they don\u2019t provide ground-breaking new controversies around it.\n\nAgain, none of this is revelatory. Nobody who has closely followed Clinton will be shocked to find her campaign was attuned to the wishes of donors. Her affinity for Israel is well known. Critics of her approach to campaign finance are mad about the decision to take money from big donors \u2014 not the internal discussion over whether or not to do so.\n\nBut watching how all of this unfolded \u2014 seeing for yourself how Clinton spoke gently to Wall Street \u2014 won\u2019t make the disclosures any easier for her detractors to swallow. It\u2019s a confirmation of what we already know, but that doesn\u2019t make it any less astonishing, at least for Clinton\u2019s critics.\n\nClinton\u2019s close ties to Wall Street and big donors are certainly part of the story revealed by the Podesta leaks. But only one part.\n\nIndeed, dozens of interesting tidbits have also emerged that allow us to see inside the Clinton campaign\u2019s infrastructure. They have showed that, at some times, the Clinton campaign openly discussed the \"political\" implications of her deciding to get behind one policy or another. They also show the Clinton campaign at other times responding to more high-minded policy concerns.\n\nIn one leak, for instance, Clinton\u2019s team discussed at length whether they should endorse the reinstatement of the Glass-Steagall Act, which would restrict commercial banks\u2019 ability to engage in some investment activity.\n\nClinton aide Mandy Grunwald worries that reversing course and backing the law would lead to \"phoniness charges,\" while not doing so could lead Sen. Elizabeth Warren to endorse Bernie Sanders. (\"Jake\" in the following exchange is Jake Sullivan, a top Clinton adviser):\n\nThen there\u2019s a lengthy exchange in Clinton-world about a carbon tax proposal. As Vox\u2019s Brad Plumer explains, the emails show how fears of embracing an unpopular idea dominated the internal discussion. Robby Mook, a top Clinton aide, said that embracing the carbon tax would prove \"lethal\" in the general election:\n\nBut other revelations have pointed to how the Clinton campaign got behind positions it found genuinely worthwhile. In one exchange highlighted by the Washington Post, the Clinton team talked about forming the \"signature pillars of a future progressive agenda\" like a \"significant middle-class tax cut.\"\n\nThe exchange about the carbon tax did involve frank political talk. But as Plumer also noted, Podesta elsewhere makes genuine efforts to convince his colleagues about the menace posed by climate change and the need for genuinely huge solutions to address it:\n\nThere are other examples. A debate over the \"Cadillac Tax,\" which taxes the most expensive health insurance plans, showed twin impulses fighting against each other. As Vox has written, the tax is widely seen as an essential way to raise revenue for Obamacare. But it\u2019s also hated by unions, whose votes and endorsements Clinton wanted to cultivate during the primary.\n\nThe emails reveal Clinton\u2019s policy advisers arguing for a \"fix it\" strategy, while the \"political team\" pushed harder for her to call for a full repeal. (They ultimately came down fully on the political side):\n\nNone of Clinton\u2019s critics will be surprised to find her team debating political ramifications of certain policies \u2014 it\u2019s certainly widely understood that this is how almost all politicians make their decisions.\n\nBut a fair appraisal of the emails doesn't reduce Team Clinton to opportunism. Even behind closed doors, they appear motivated by a genuine embrace of progressive beliefs and causes. At least much of the time, that is. But not always.\n\nLet's be honest: Everyone who has worked in a big enough office has said or written something about a co-worker he or she wouldn't say to that co-worker\u2019s face.\n\nClinton-world is no exception. But most offices don\u2019t have to deal with essentially all of their internal communications being dumped unceremoniously on the web. Team Clinton\u2019s internal gossip and snipings have been neatly organized into a searchable database that the whole world can use.\n\nThese are, understandably, the best catnip for reporters. Like the other revelations, they also don\u2019t tend to reveal anything genuinely earth-shattering. But by laying bare the bitter grievances we (generally) already knew about, these emails are fueling added frustration and old grudges. For instance, the emails include:\n\nThis kind of stuff, of course, has the least to do with public policy or the positions of the campaign.\n\nBut this category of emails is perhaps most interesting to people who work for Clinton. In a terrific article in Politico, Annie Karni and Glenn Thrush detailed the psychological impacts it\u2019s having on the Clinton campaign:\n\nAs Karni and Thrush note, this should be a heady time for Clinton-world. She\u2019s cruising to victory in the polls. Donald Trump has sunk in the polls, and Clinton has trounced him in three consecutive presidential debates.\n\nIn general, the critics most upset about the Podesta emails are the ones who have confirmed what Clinton\u2019s inner-circle thought about them. Ironically, that dynamic now appears to apply to Clinton\u2019s own team as well.\n\nTwo clear conclusions jump out when trying to determine what these emails tell us about a future Clinton presidency.\n\nOne is that Clinton appears genuinely responsive to pressure from outside groups. Her team has clear goals, but they\u2019re also closely attuned to polls and to winning over the organizations (union backers, environmentalist groups, Black Lives Matter activists) whose support they think they need. In private conversations, Clinton tells the audiences in front of her more or less what they want to hear.\n\nBut while this appreciation for her listeners may reflect political savvy, it also suggests a flexibility that may worry those on her left. What happens if President Clinton gets polling suggesting a majority of voters support slashing entitlements? What if the country clamors for a war in Iran? What if she can win over Republican voters by tacking to the center?\n\nAnd second, more than anything, the Podesta emails show how Clinton is the transactional politician many have long suspected. That\u2019s a dispiriting conclusion for some who may wish she was a pure progressive. But it also helps clarify the battle lines for what looks like the coming Clinton administration \u2014 persuade her team they need you, and you might have a shot at getting them on your side.", "261": "  Have you heard of Dr. William Thompson? If you haven\u2019t, you\u2019re not alone. His story was completely ignored by mainstream media outlets, the same way that they recently ignored the fact that the Pentagon paid a PR firm half a billon dollars to make fake terrorist/news videos.   Dr. William Thompson is a longtime senior CDC scientist. He has published some of the most commonly cited pro-vaccine studies \u2014 studies which purport to show absolutely no link between the MMR vaccine and autism, for example. Two studies he and his co-author published in 2004 and 2007 (CDC studies) were the most commonly cited studies used by the scientific community to debunk the controversy surrounding the MMR vaccine/autism link. ( Thompson, et al. 2007, Price, et al. 2010 , Destefano, et al. 2004 ) The study concluded that \u201cthe evidence is now convincing that the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine does not cause autism or any particular subtypes of autism spectrum disorder.\u201d ( source ) A decade later, Dr. Thompson came out publicly admitting that that it was \u201cthe lowest point \u201d in his career when he \u201cwent along with that paper.\u201d He went on to say that he and the other authors \u201cdidn\u2019t report significant findings\u201d and that he is \u201ccompletely ashamed\u201d of what he did, that he was \u201ccomplicit and went along with this,\u201d and regrets that he has \u201cbeen a part of the problem.\u201d ( source )( source )( source ) A study with revised information and no data omission was published by Dr. Brian Hooker (a contact of Dr. Thompson) in the peer reviewed journal Translational Neurodegeneration, and it found a 340% increased risk of autism in African American boys receiving the Measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine on time. The study has since been retracted during the same time of this controversy.   You can read the full study HERE , although, unsurprisingly, it has since been retracted. Thompson\u2019s attorneys, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and Bryan Smith of Morgan & Morgan, also released a statement from Dr. Thompson, which mentioned Hooker: \u201c I have had many discussions with Dr. Brian Hooker over the last 10 months regarding studies the CDC has carried out regarding vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes including autism spectrum disorders. I share his belief that CDC decision-making and analyses should be transparent.\u201d ( source ) Even pro-vaccine politicians were contacted, as these documents were sent to Congress. One of them reads as followed, as illustrated by congressman Bill Posey : \u201cThe [CDC] co-authors scheduled a meeting to destroy documents related to the [MMR vaccine] study. The remaining four co-authors all met and brought a big garbage can into the meeting room and reviewed and went through all the hard copy documents that we had thought we should discard and put them in a huge garbage can.\u201d CDC Blocking Testimony Disconcertingly, Thomas Frieden (see picture above), the Director of the Centres for Disease Control (CDC), has blocked Dr. Thompson\u2019s attempt to testify on scientific fraud and the destruction of evidence by senior CDC officials. Attorneys Smith and Kennedy have been seeking to have Thompson testify on medical malpractice, specifically with regard to fraud in a series of studies that found no link between vaccines and autism, which are cited earlier in the article. Mr. Kennedy writes that, according to Thompson, \u201cfor the past decade his superiors have pressured him and his fellow scientists to lie and manipulate data about the safety of the mercury-based preservative thimerosal to conceal its causative link to a suite of brain injuries, including autism.\u201d Ecowatch , Dr. Frieden said that \u201cDr. William Thompson\u2019s deposition testimony would not substantially promote the objectives of CDC or HHS [Health and Human Services].\u201d Despite the fact that Thompson revealed a casual link between vaccines and autism, or autistic features, Frieden stated that \u201cDr William Thompson\u2019s deposition testimony would not substantially promote the objectives of CDC or HHD.\u201d The case seeking the testimony of Dr. Thompson is from the family of 16-year-old Yates Hazlehurst. A lawsuit is currently underway implying that Yates is autistic as a result of vaccine administration that occurred in 2001.

While many of the more obscure right -wing blogs named nothing but imaginary sources to support their outrageous claims , the most legitimate source of the false story was none other than Fox News. \nOn November 2 Fox News\u2019 Bret Baier claimed that, according to two anonymous sources within the FBI, the agency\u2019s investigation of Clinton would \u201ccontinue to likely an indictment.\u201d The very next day reality forced him to walk back those claims, which he called \u201cinartful,\u201d acknowledging that \u201cthat\u2019s not the process.\u201d \nNonetheless, Baier did not entirely disavow his ruse of an imminent Clinton indictment, maintaining that \u201cthere is confidence in the evidence.\u201d Given that Clinton\u2019s indictment has been impending for months in the right-wing universe one would think that these shameless schemers would have wised up to the fact that it\u2019s not going to happen \u2013 and for good reason . Instead, every time there is the slightest mention of Clinton\u2019s emails, no matter how vague and clearly inconsequential , the alt-right rumor mill kicks into overdrive on its vicious crusade to smear the potential first female president in any way possible. \nIn reality, there is absolutely nothing so far to suggest that there is anything incriminating in the most recent batch of Clinton emails, and it has become increasingly clear that FBI Director James Comey\u2019s announcement of the renewed investigation was nothing but a cynical and hypocritical political ploy. In part the announcement was designed to fuel a new Republican storyline that Clinton is unfit for the presidency because she is under federal investigation. The demagogues making these claims conveniently ignore the fact that Trump is under investigation in no fewer than 75 cases , including the rape of a 13 year-old girl. \nAnother disconcerting storyline in yesterday\u2019s firestorm of right-wing rumors is the political interference of Trump supporters in the FBI. If Baier\u2019s so-called anonymous sources really were FBI agents, it would represent yet another recent example of meddling in the presidential election by Trump supporters at the supposedly impartial agency. In any case, the endless lies and distortions of the right-wing pseudo-media, from Fox News down to the lowliest blog, are doing a tremendous disservice to the American people.", "263": "Q. If Trump wins can it be considered a repudiation of the national news mediocrity? A. I certainly hope so! \nThe performance of the major news outlets this election cycle has been something to behold. It\u2019s been the worst, most shallow undertaking I can remember. And I remember the treatment Goldwater got. \nI wrote here on Lew\u2019s blog last week about the hysterical reaction Gloria Borger and others had to Trump\u2019s unwillingness to promise to respect the election results in advance. \nThey acted like panicked teenage girls in a horror movie. \nPat Buchanan explains the media\u2019s panic. \u201cThe establishment is terrified that it has lost the country,\u201d he says. \u201cThe country no longer believes in its leadership.\u201d \nAbout time! \nNow with the Comey development it won\u2019t be long before Dems start talking about a rigged system. \nAnother moment of equal media idiocracy: When the Clintonistas blamed Russia for spilling DNC emails that showed its secret collaboration with Hillary and against Bernie Sanders. \nTrump said \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing!\u201d \nThe line wasn\u2019t well-delivered. But it was still funny. \nEven so, the joke was lost on the usual suspects. I watched CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper\u2019s visage grow dark as he expressed grave concern that Trump was inviting the Russians to interfere in our election. \nThe whole thing brings to mind an old vaudeville comedy routine with, let\u2019s say, Joe and Moe: Joe: I\u2019m offended by the media\u2019s alarmist reaction to Trump\u2019s email joke. Moe: Are you offended as a Trump supporter? Joe: No, I\u2019m offended as a person with a sense of humor! 11:09 am on October 29, 2016", "264": "October 27, 2016 \nI don't think it's possible that there is a man on DS that hates Smerconish more than I do.

This because, as a diehard Cubs fan, I was up until nearly 1:00 AM working to come to grips with what I had just witnessed. Once I finally went to bed I found myself tossing and turning so at 3:30 I said screw it\u2026 I\u2019m heading to the office.\nMy beloved Cubbies had just won the World Series, defeating the Cleveland Indians in what is likely to go down as one of the most EPIC game 7 battles in the history of professional baseball. The Cubs haven\u2019t won a World Series since 1908, making this Championship something we Cubs fans could only dream about until it actually happened last night.\nAs prediction hub FiveThirtyEight put it just a few days ago\u2026 the chances were slim. How slim? Slimmer than the odds of Trump winning next Tuesday.\n\nAn impossible scenario just become very possible. And fortunately for America, another seemingly impossible scenario is now suddenly started to look very possible.\nA Hillary Clinton indictment is now likely .\nThis coming via FBI sources telling Fox News host Bret Baier that the FBI is moving towards what is \u201clikely an indictment.\u201d\nBaier\u2019s report includes the following key points .\n1. The Clinton Foundation investigation is far more expansive than anybody has reported so far and has been going on for more than a year.\n2. The laptops of Clinton aides Cherryl Mills and Heather Samuelson have not been destroyed, and agents are currently combing through them. The investigation has interviewed several people twice, and plans to interview some for a third time.\n3. Agents have found emails believed to have originated on Hillary Clinton\u2019s secret server on Anthony Weiner\u2019s laptop. They say the emails are not duplicates and could potentially be classified in nature.\n4. Sources within the FBI have told him that an indictment is \u201clikely\u201d in the case of pay-for-play at the Clinton Foundation, \u201cbarring some obstruction in some way\u201d from the Justice Department.\n5. FBI sources say with 99% accuracy that Hillary Clinton\u2019s server has been hacked by at least five foreign intelligence agencies, and that information had been taken from it.\nThat\u2019s a pretty strong case for indictment. Of course, the corrupted DOJ can still do everything in its power to block justice, but it now appears the FBI is throwing DOJ demands out the window.\nGonna be an interesting few days ahead, folks. For those of us who are Cubs fans and news junkies sleep is not on the agenda.\n", "266": "Originally appeared at Strategic Culture Foundation \nBoth inside the US and around the world, political observers have been waiting a long time for an election that would promise relief from the most noxious features of the American system. Alas, while it is high time that the US lead the way in reversing these trends, the outcome of the 18 month struggle to elect a new administration looks likely to scuttle all hopes for serious leadership and reform. \nI'm looking forward to a market crash to awaken the electorate out of our rut, honestly. Because if a Loony Tunes candidate {meaning Donald Trump \u2013 DK} doesn't give Democrats the courage to put up a push-left candidate {Bernie Sanders, or some facsimile \u2013 DK}, then catastrophe is the only correction we have left. \u2013 commenter \u00abSnapshotist\u00bb \nBoth inside the US and around the world, political observers have been waiting a long time for an election that would promise relief from the most noxious features of the American system, such as neoliberal economic austerity policies that hamstring governments' ability to maintain basic services and safety nets, military aggression and destabilization of regimes across a wide swathe of the globe, wholesale violation of privacy via NSA surveillance, trade agreements designed to maximize the power of international corporations over national governments, facilitation of fossil fuel extraction and infrastructure in the face of dire climate change consequences, a financial system sucking wealth away from the population and accelerating wealth inequality, and more. \nAlas, while it is high time that the US lead the way in reversing these trends, the outcome of the 18 month struggle to elect a new presidential administration looks likely to scuttle all hopes for serious leadership and reform on any of these critical issues. It follows, therefore, that in the near term (if not longer), progress will not be possible unless new forms of politics arise to deliver pressure from below on Washington, DC. But how much hope can we have for that? When will see this again? Crowds lining up hours in advance for a Bernie Sanders rally, New York, April 13th, 2016 \nA Trump Contribution? \nBy all indications, Clinton will win the election on November 8th, and virtually every political commentator will rejoice at the apparent demise of the Donald Trump phenomenon. As strange as it may seem, however, some of the passion of the Trump movement could provide fuel to the fire of reformist politics in the US. To be sure, Trump's campaign has gone far towards legitimizing and normalizing bigotry and ignorance, and this residue will persist. But Trump has also galvanized powerful resentment against an insular, self-serving political class. This sentiment dovetails with a major thrust of Bernie Sanders's advocacy of social democratic policies and empowerment of the population to reverse the accumulation of all power in the hands of wealthy campaign donors and corporations. \nFurther, let us not forget, Trump has consistently promoted the idea of shelving antagonism towards Russia in favor of cooperation, together with reducing the role of the US military around the world. The point is not whether Trump genuinely means what he says (although one of his advisors who spoke with us insists that he does). The point is that Trump brought these positions out into the light, which has allowed increasing numbers of Americans to question the nation's reflexive reliance on military might, expansion, and aggression as a pillar of its foreign policy. If the left is truly serious about unseating Washington's neoliberal status quo, it should make every effort to harness some of the frustration that coalesced into the Trump movement towards broadly shared goals \u2013 getting the money out of politics being the most obvious. \nThe Gullible Left \nFor the moment, of course, the huge majority of the left is consumed with the impending election, and with the perceived imperative of defeating Trump by supporting Clinton as the \u00ablesser evil\u00bb candidate. At first glance this seems eminently reasonable. But the certitude that has swept the country regarding the preferability of Clinton over Trump ought to give us pause. For those paying close attention, it is not necessarily clear which candidate is the lesser evil. The flaws marring each candidate are so grotesque, and the variables confronting the next administration are so uncertain, that one can easily support a case in either direction. A small segment of the left will reject both Brahmins and cast affirmative votes for Green Party candidate Jill Stein, of course. But the readiness of much of the left \u2013 the gullible left \u2013 to ignore Clinton's corruption, crimes, and cynicism is preemptively sapping the strength of the resistance that will be needed to push Madame President to pursue even half-baked progressive reforms on any issue. \nMeanwhile, as the gullible left and center coalesce meekly around Clinton, the real election is taking place behind the scenes: Clinton and her inner circle are lining up the key personnel who will largely determine the course of policy in her administration. Thanks to Wikileaks' publication of Clinton's current campaign chairman, John Podesta, we know very well that this process is far advanced by now. As David Dayen put it recently in \u00ab The New Republic \u00bb: \nIf the 2008 Podesta emails are any indication, the next four years of public policy are being hashed out right now, behind closed doors.... Who gets these cabinet-level and West Wing advisory jobs matters as much as policy papers or legislative initiatives. It will inform executive branch priorities and responses to crises. It will dictate the level of enforcement of existing laws. It will establish the point of view of an administration and the advice Hillary Clinton will receive. Its importance cannot be stressed enough, and the process has already begun. This is a fight over who dominates the Democratic Party\u2019s policy thinking in the short and long term. \nDayen adds that \u00ab...if liberals want to have an impact on that process, waiting until after the election will be too late\u00bb. Well, one wonders why Dayen is so optimistic. Another Wikileaks release revealed that Clinton had more or less decided on Tim Kaine as her running mate all the way back in mid-2015 (!). Surely many of the top positions have long since been scripted, and for those still in play, can anyone \u2013 even David Dayen -- imagine public pressure making a difference in the selection? \nIn short, the world should prepare itself for a Hillary Clinton administration that is full of Washington establishment clones and is diligently protected from criticism by a like-minded media establishment. Moreover, and more important, we can already see the Clinton administration maneuvering to avoid the gridlock that minimized President Obama's effectiveness by pushing key foreign and domestic policies further to the right, into the arms of the Republican Party. It is not difficult to locate telling indications on this score... \u00abSorry, I can't vote for Mrs. Strangelove\u00bb \u2013 commenter \u00abnatureboy\u00bb , renouncing Clinton for her hawkishness \nThe implications of Clinton's ascendancy on US foreign policy are already coming into view, and they are more than a little disturbing. An article from Washington Post White House correspondent Greg Jaffe on October 20th delivered news just as bad as we expected: \nThe Republicans and Democrats who make up the foreign policy elite are laying the groundwork for a more assertive American foreign policy via a flurry of reports shaped by officials who are likely to play senior roles in a potential Clinton White House.... the bipartisan nature of the recent recommendations, coming at a time when the country has never been more polarized, reflects a remarkable consensus among the foreign policy elite. This consensus is driven by a broad-based backlash against a president who has repeatedly stressed the dangers of overreach and the need for restraint, especially in the Middle East\u2026 Taken together, the studies and reports call for more-aggressive American action to constrain Iran, rein in the chaos in the Middle East and check Russia in Europe. \nClinton is preparing a foreign policy more aggressive than Obama's, in other words. And \u2013 take note \u2013 she'll enjoy bipartisan support for it. \u00abThe entire concept is a form of corporate blackmail\u00bb -- David Dayen , characterizing Clinton's preparation of a tax repatriation policy that will permanently lower the tax obligations of large corporations. \nAs far as domestic policy is concerned, meanwhile, all recent revelations point to a posture even more friendly to large corporate interests than that which has obtained under Obama. For example, an important investigation from David Dayen just a few days ago exposed the Clinton circle's coordination with top Democrats and Republicans in preparing an enormous and permanent reduction on taxation of profits corporations earn abroad. As journalist Matt Taibbi once described a similar proposal: \u00abLet's give a big tax break to the biggest tax cheats\u00bb. \nYes, we can expect a few corporate-written trade deals to follow the tax reduction on profits earned overseas. And Wall Street will not be left out. Clinton has many options to assist her finance sector sponsors, including an important plan David Sirota and Avi Asher-Shapiro revealed last week. It would deliver hundreds of billions of dollars worth of individuals' retirement accounts into the hands of asset managers employing aggressive alternative investment strategies, and net the managers billions a year in fees.

But they're also more likely to say that 'their' candidates are treated too harshly.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump (l.), is interviewed by co-hosts Matt Lauer and Savannah Guthrie on the NBC 'Today' television program, in New York, on April 21, 2016.\n\nBoth presidential campaigns have been outspoken in saying that they think the media are too hard on them. But do Americans agree?\n\nMore Americans think the media are letting presidential candidates off easy than in previous years, according to a poll released by the Pew Research Center on Thursday. In the case of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, 27 percent of Americans think the media is too easy on him, compared to 20 percent who reported feeling that way about coverage of the 2012 Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, and 15 percent for John McCain in 2008. Some 33 percent of Americans think coverage of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is too easy, compared to 28 percent and 31 percent for President Obama in 2012 and 2008, respectively, according to the survey.\n\nPositive attitudes toward the media have reportedly been declining since the 1970s. Less than one-third of people now say that they have a \u201cgreat deal\u201d or \u201cfair amount\u201d of trust in the media. Scholars say this is part of a larger trend in poor attitudes toward institutions generally, compounded by a rise in the number of media outlets and the polarization of these outlets.\n\nWhen people \"go into their newsfeed or turn on the TV and they're getting information from a wide array of sources, and some of them are less than reputable ... it contributes to the sense\" that all media is untrustworthy, David Jones, a professor of political science at James Madison University, told The Christian Science Monitor\u2019s Gretel Kauffman earlier this month.\n\nA question about Americans\u2019 attitude toward \u201cthe media\u201d could refer to information expressing all kinds of opinions, in forums as large as a TV network or national newspaper or as small as a Twitter feed.\n\nThis polarity and range of sources could help explain why rising numbers of Americans also think that \u201cthe media\u201d is being unnecessarily harsh \u2013\u00a0on their chosen candidates, that is. Pew reported that three-in-ten Democrats and independents who lean Democratic are likely to see coverage of Mrs. Clinton as too tough. Nearly half of Republican surveyed \u2013 46 percent \u2013 believe that coverage of Mr. Trump has been too tough.\n\nFinding the middle ground certainly isn\u2019t easy. And nowhere is this clearer than in the high-stakes world of interviews and presidential debates. The Associated Press highlighted the demands placed on moderators with these guidelines offered during the 2012 election cycle:\n\nCraft sharp questions to get the candidates to talk, while being meticulously fair not to challenge one more than another. Keep an eye on the clock so one candidate doesn't get to hog the time. Don't be bullied; be firm in forcing the candidates to move on. But be flexible enough to keep a productive discussion flowing. Know the difference. Keep the focus off yourself. And do it all on live television before some 60 million people.\n\nMatt Lauer\u2019s performance at NBC\u2019s Commander-in-Chief forum earlier this month\u00a0was widely panned, with critics saying that he focused too heavily on Clinton\u2019s email server and failed to fact-check some of Trump\u2019s statements. Candy Crowley, whose moderation of a 2012 debate Rush Limbaugh described as \u201can act of journalistic terror,\u201d later told the Associated Press that she knew from the beginning that \u201csomebody is always going to be unhappy no matter what you do.\u201d\n\nFor some, the media\u2019s election coverage \u2013 and Americans\u2019 trust in the media on the basis of this coverage \u2013 is critical to American democracy.\n\n\"Citizens need information, they need to get it from the media.\u00a0The First Amendment was set up to create a media that served as a surrogate role for the public, and if the public is not engaged and they move on and they're not consuming news ... it's really a disservice and it hurts our democracy a lot,\" Jeff McCall, a professor of communication at DePauw University, told Fox News's Bill O'Reilly following a 2014 Gallup poll.", "270": "By Brig Asif H. Raja on October 31, 2016 \nAsif Haroon Raja \nEditor\u2019s note: Both BG Raja and Imran Khan are VT followers and personal friends of the Senior Editor. This is a vital untold story. IK isn\u2019t returning emails and it would be nice to hear his side. Our bureau chief in Islamabad, Raja Mujtaba, has been gone for two years now, a huge loss for VT. \n\nImran Khan (IK) and his partner Sheikh Rashid pursuing politics of agitation since mid-2014 are once again on a rampage and are determined to lock down Islamabad (Isbd) and seize power by force. Their tantrums have shot up the political temperature to a boiling point and has intensified uncertainty and insecurity. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) Chief Minister Pervez Khattak along with PTI workers is exultantly moving in a convoy from Peshawar to reach Bani Gala and participate in the already declared November 2, D-Day for the final showdown with the government (govt) at D-chowk. He has puerilely given an ethnic color to his march by playing the Pashtun card. He and his convey has been greeted by the Punjab Police with tear gas shells at Attock Bridge and Hazro interchange. The PML-Q, PAT and PSP have pledged support to IK but from a distance. The PPP is gearing up to add fuel to fire. Maulana Fazlur Rahman led JUI-F has stood up in support of the beleaguered PML-N and has warned PTI that its march to Isbd will be contested. ANP, NP, QWP and MQM (P) sympathies are also with the ruling party. \nThe fires of agitation lit by the PTI has spread to other cities as well. Containerization has taken the life of one army officer and one child and is causing great inconvenience to the dwellers of twin cities. Media is playing its usual negative role to keep the pot sizzling. One-seater Sheikh Rashid is being glorified and so is the bellicosity of IK, while govt\u2019s defensive acts are demeaned. Anchors and analysts are busy upping the ante and none seem to be interested in defusing the volatile situation. Hate campaign against NS and his family by the social media has touched new heights of slander. Political wrangling and filibustering is further damaging the image of Pakistan in the world and the cause of Kashmir. \nThe master planners sitting in London, Washington, Tel Aviv and New Delhi are keeping their fingers crossed and are excitedly watching the gathering storm and hoping that the govt machinery in Isbd will be paralyzed and will force Nawaz Sharif (NS) to resign, or the Army to intervene and take over. India is incessantly throwing logs into the fire by heating up the LoC, while RAW-NDS are continuing with their covert operations in selected zones. Their major interest is to disrupt work on CPEC. \nFollowers of IK are bubbling with enthusiasm and have gone hyper. Some were caught carrying weapons, ammunition, tear gas shells and bullet proof jackets. Most are carrying batons and young girls are equally aggressive. PTI\u2019s armed Tiger Force has been tasked to battle with the Police/FC if stopped. They are already seeing their charismatic leader wearing the crown and with Aladdin lamp in his hand removing all the chronic ailments of Pakistan in a flash. They are convinced that once he seizes power, milk and honey will start flowing in the rivers of Pakistan and miseries of the downtrodden will be alleviated. One reason of their euphoria is the apparent estrangement of the Army leadership over the security leak scandal. Their joys knew no bounds when Information Minister Pervez Rashid was sacked. It was seen as the beginning of the demise of NS Empire. It has further energized the PTI workers and they seem fully charged up to execute the orders of their Captain to lock down the capital city on November 2. IK has taken it as a last ditch battle. For him it is a do or die battle. He is once again expectantly looking towards Gen Raheel Sharif to raise his finger. \nUndoubtedly the security leak has suddenly become a bigger challenge for the govt than the IK threat. A high powered committee comprising of members from ISI, MI and IB will carry out in-depth investigation to trace out the culprits responsible for feeding the story and that too in twisted form to the Dawn newspaper, who were behind it, what was the motive, apportion blame and prescribe punishment. It is to be seen where the trail ends. Absence of the author of the controversial story Cyril Almeida will make things difficult for the investigators. \nUnlike its defensive stance to the 2014 sit-in, which had lingered on for 126 days without any outcome, this time the govt is in a defiant mood and is flexing its muscles to go to any length to defeat the sinister plans of the invaders. Containers have been placed on all entry points of Isbd and along Peshawar-Isbd road and along Bani Gala road. Large contingents of the police and paramilitary troops have been deployed while the army has been alerted to be prepared to defend Isbd under Article 245. At the moment, the entire leadership of PTI have got stranded in IK residence at Bani Gala. NS has addressed two public meetings in KP and his tone and tenor gave no sign of nervousness. Rather he was quite confident to win next elections in 2018 on the strength of his achievements and dismal performance of PTI in KP and PPP in Sindh. The govt side is of the view that there is no reason for IK to agitate when the Supreme Court has accepted his petition and NS has been summoned on account of Panama scandal. They say, PTI youth wing violated the curfew imposed under Section 144 CrPC and also defied Isbd High Court restraining order not to create mayhem. \nPervez Rashid was in bad books of IK and his colleagues due to his counter jibes whenever IK lambasted NS. But he was not the most sought target. His unceremonious exit or an in-house change doesn\u2019t fulfil the ambition of IK to become the PM. He desires that NS should be booted out or he quits voluntarily irrespective of the fact that his name does not appear in the list of account holders in Off Shore Company. He has no idea what is in store for him if NS is forced to throw in his towel. In all likelihood, the ruckus in the aftermath of NS departure will drown IK\u2019s ambitions. It cannot be denied that NS is still the most popular leader and he has many feathers in his cap. His 3 rd time premature boot out will make him a political martyr and will not be taken lightly by his fans in Punjab. Baluchistan govt and JUI-F would also not welcome his ouster particularly when he had presented him and his family for accountability and the matter was with the courts. \nThe situation will become ripe for chaos which outside powers have all along been trying to foment. The Army may have to grudgingly step in to restore semblance of order. In the wake of tense geo-political environment, terrorism, acute polarization, feudal mindset, partisanship, parochialism and secular-Islamic divide, it will not be possible for the Army to restore order and hold elections within three months as prescribed in the constitution. Supposedly, if elections do take place within 3 months, PML-N will surely win the race and perhaps PTI may lose KP as well. \nElections without reforms will otherwise be an exercise in futility. The Army will perforce have to stretch its rule to 3-5 years if not more to be able to take Operation Zarb-e-Azb, Rangers operation in Karachi, FC operation in Baluchistan and ongoing combing operation to their logical ends; to implement the National Action Plan in letter and spirit, and to complete the vital project of CPEC. Additionally it will have to carry out following reforms for a better morrow and for enabling environment for true democracy to flourish: 1. Electoral, political, police, bureaucracy, judicial, education, media reforms. 2. Breaking the nexus between crime, politics, terrorism and corruption. 3. Effective accountability system. 4. Cleansing the Aegean Stables. \nAll this will be possible only when there is strict martial law and politicians of all hues are kept at bay. Will this arrangement be acceptable to IK? If he is prepared to wait for 5 years, why not hold on for 1 \u00bd years and contest the 2018 elections and win the coveted crown!! Moreover, what is the guarantee that the Army will be able to put everything right since it was not able to do so in the past? Things may become messier. Memory of our people is very short lived. Soon they will forget the ills of NS and his good deeds will be recalled with fondness and the Army will be put on the mat with a vengeance as had happened during the four military rules. True to their tradition, anti-Pakistan foreign powers will be behind the anti-Army campaign. Political destabilization suit the conspirators since it makes it easier for them to exert pressure and dictate terms. It is indeed most unfortunate that our politicians are fighting for power among each other, while the media and so-called educated lot are supporting their favorite political leaders and feel no qualm in passing lecherous and insulting remarks against their opponents. Preferably, all our guns should be collectively firing at our enemies who are bent upon breaking up Pakistan. \nThe writer is a retired Brig, war veteran, defence analyst, columnist, author of 5 books, Vice Chairman Thinkers Forum Pakistan, DG Measac Research Centre, Member Executive Council PESS. asifharoonraja@gmail.com Related Posts:", "271": "NBC affiliate WRCB TV in Chattanooga, Tennessee has inadvertently posted election night results.

", "272": "By all accounts Loretta Lynch, president Obama\u2019s choice to replace Eric Holder as attorney general, was very impressive in the first day of hearings. In fact, she was so impressive that even\u00a0the right-wing bloggers\u00a0at Powerline called her the Ernie Banks of nominees, which, judging from their\u00a0eulogy for the real Ernie Banks, is very good indeed. But then they also said the committee was throwing softballs, so the metaphors got a little confusing.\u00a0 It was a very good day for Loretta Lynch, much to their chagrin. She was appropriately confident, dignified and boring and thus made for a dull affair that was unlikely to derail her nomination.\n\nThe second day of hearings, in which both Republicans and Democrats on the committee invited both people to testify, was a little bit more lively. We knew it would be when the committee announced their guests. The Democrats offered a group of former colleagues and law professors. The Republicans offered a couple of conservative law professors to denounce President Obama\u2019s usurpation of democracy \u2014 and some far-right-wing activists to complain about being victimized.\n\nThe first person to testify was someone who had never met or had any knowledge of Loretta Lynch. This was\u00a0former reporter and current right-wing icon Sharyl Attkisson\u00a0who told a harrowing story of harassment, including her questionable allegation that the government bugged her computer, obviously shocking the likes of Chuck Grassley and Orrin Hatch to the depth of their souls. It\u2019s one thing for the government to relentlessly pursue reporters like James Risen who report serious and important stories. They wholeheartedly support the Justice Department in such cases. Attkisson, however,\u00a0resigned from CBS News\u00a0because she felt the entire network was biased in favor of the Obama administration and refused to allow her to pursue the scandals she just knew were there. (These were scandals like Benghazi and Fast and Furious \u2014 scandals that have been investigated approximately 756 times under every committee in the Congress and have turned up zilch.) Somehow they\u2019ve managed to morph this professional dispute into a story of Attkisson being victimized by the authoritarian police state.\n\nIt would have been interesting to hear testimony about the government\u2019s pursuit of leaks and reporters over the past few years, which really is a scandal and which should form the basis of questioning for the new attorney general. But since both parties are generally in favor of this practice, that wasn\u2019t to be. Instead the Republicans called one of their celebrity martyrs to testify about how hard it is for a conservative to live in this world.\n\nThe next activist they called to testify about Loretta Lynch was a man who admittedly has absolutely no knowledge of her but had something to say about how Eric Holder was very mean to police officers around the country. He is an African-American sheriff from Wisconsin named\u00a0David Clarke\u00a0who up to this point is best known for his appearances on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d in which he says things like, \u201cthe NAACP is nothing more than a propaganda entity for the left\u201d and that the behavior of black people is the reason they are getting shot so often. He suggested that the federal government is waging a war on police and should butt out of local business.\n\nThe final activist of the day was a citizen who has been working her heart out trying to protect our electoral system from the scourge of nonexistent voter fraud. That would be a woman named Catherine Englebrecht, who runs\u00a0a far-right-wing group called True the Vote,\u00a0which sends out groups of \u201cobservers\u201d to African-American and Hispanic polling places to make sure they\u2019re not stealing the votes of decent Americans. Upon Eric Holder\u2019s resignation, her group put out a press release stating that Holder had carried out a\u00a0\u201cradical, racialist assault on voting rights.\u201d\u00a0She was there to complain about the Department of Justice failing to immediately interview her over the alleged IRS scandal and to excoriate them over the \u201cnightmare of citizen targeting.\u201d She then testified that Loretta Lynch was wrong in saying that laws had been passed throughout the South to prevent some people from voting. Sen. Jeff Sessions pointed out that an Alabama Tea Party leader had been victimized by the IRS and nobody at the IRS cares. Sen. Orrin Hatch expressed his deepest sympathy for what she\u2019s been through and assured her that they were going to get to bottom of it. Her voice cracked with emotion as she said, \u201cThank you, sir.\u201d This was the first committee hearing of the new Senate Judiciary Committee under GOP rule, a hearing to determine the fitness of a presidential nominee to the most powerful law enforcement office in the land, and they called a group of partisan crackpots and grass-roots loons to relitigate moldy pseudo-scandals and complain about nonexistent government persecution. And it\u2019s not as if they couldn\u2019t have found some real scandals to talk about. The Obama Justice Department is hardly perfect. But they are married to their Foxified version of reality and simply can\u2019t see the forest for the trees. The whole spectacle was a nostalgic trip back in time to the days of Clinton madness when the judiciary committees were able to leverage any public hearing into a scandal fest. The press seems less inclined to go along these days, a fact that Sharyl Attkisson would surely attribute to its political bias. But the truth is that these \u201cscandals\u201d are just sad echoes of the scandal-mongering of the 1990s. The energy is gone, the issues seem pale and lifeless. Not that there was ever any \u201cthere\u201d there, but they are now just going through the motions. But I hope Democrats don\u2019t get too complacent. President Obama has never been able to get their scandal mojo rising. But there\u2019s every reason to suspect that this is just an off-season workout for what they see as a return to the big leagues. If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency you can be sure there will be a return to the fiery investigations whenever the Republicans hold either house of Congress. And if history serves, the press will likely be eager to join the team. But this sad little show reveals just how much they are in need of some spring training. Loretta Lynch may be a genial public servant in the mold of Ernie Banks, but when it comes to scandal management, Clinton is Babe Ruth. They are going to need to up their game significantly.", "273": "Conventional wisdom holds that Sen.

For example, his suggestion that the Republicans should become a pro-choice party likely wrinkled few brows among his core supporters.\n\nThe idea that Trump would change his attitude and approach along with his opinions wouldn\u2019t trouble many who have faith in him as a man and a leader. For those who believe the Trump is the only person who can make America great again, putting on a new guise for the general election would be nothing troubling.\n\nRemember, these are people who believe him when he describes himself as the new Reagan and the person more presidential than anybody since Lincoln.\n\nBut can Trump create a habitat that is healthy for both his backers and the kinds of folks that his newly expanded campaign are schmoozing here in Hollywood without further antagonizing the substantial chunk of his party that ranges from resentful to outright outraged about Trump\u2019s surprising success in overtaking the GOP?\n\nTrump had a very good day here Thursday. Aside from turning back a Rules Committee vote that might\u2019ve helped Sen.

And for those facing general election oblivion, anything that sounds like avoiding a savage showdown in Cleveland and not losing the general election by 40 states sounds good.\n\nBut even if Trump and his new handlers can keep the GOP elite and his existing populist base happy, the current maneuvers do pose a risk.\n\nThe most important thing for the Republican frontrunner right now is for his detractors and enemies on the conservative side of the party to just give up.\n\nThere are enough Republicans who loathe Trump to still stop him. But they have to go vote and they have to be willing to blow up their conventions to do it.\n\nWhen Trump\u2019s new Sherpa suggests that it has all been a fake so far, that gives new cause for alarm to the conservatives who already deeply mistrust Trump and see him as more of a Democrat than Republican.\n\nAll Trump needs in order to win is for the resistance to just lay down for a couple of weeks.

This lengthy piece goes into the origins and results of the shift in American political thought:\n\n \n\n \u201cThe smug style is a psychological reaction to a profound shift in American political demography.

Only the historically black Protestant churches have held a steady grip through the years of change.\n\nRemember the familiar map of American religion? The South: A bastion of white evangelicals. The Northeast: Cradle of Catholics. The Midwest: Nest of Mainline Protestants. The West: Incubator of \"nones\" \u2014 people who claim no religious brand label.\n\nWell, scratch all that in the new topography.\n\nThe shrinking numbers of Christians and their loss of market share is the most significant change since 2007 (when Pew did its first U.S. Religious Landscape survey) and the new, equally massive survey of 35,000 U.S. adults.\n\nThe percentage of people who describe themselves as Christians fell about 8 points \u2014 from 78.4% to 70.6%. This includes people in virtually all demographic groups, whether they are \"nearing retirement or just entering adulthood, married or single, living in the West or the Bible Belt,\" according to the survey report.\n\nMassachusetts is down on Catholics by 10 percentage points. South Carolina is down the same degree on evangelicals. Mainline Protestants, already sliding for 40 years or more, declined all over the Midwest by 3 to 4 percentage points.The Southern Baptist Convention and the United Methodist Church, the country's two largest Protestant denominations, are each down roughly the same 1.4 to 1.5 percentage points.Every tradition took a hit in in the West as the number of people who claim no religious brand continues to climb.\n\nChristian faiths are troubled by generational change \u2014 each successive group is less connected than their parents \u2014 and by \"switching\" at all ages, the report shows. While nearly 86% of Americans say they grew up as Christians, nearly one in five (19%) say they aren't so anymore.\n\n\"Overall, there are more than four former Christians for every convert to Christianity,\" said Cooperman.\n\nAlthough evangelicals are part of the decline, their slide has been less steep. They benefit from more people joining evangelical traditions, but they're hurt by generational change and by America's increased diversity.\n\nAccording to the survey, white \"born-again or evangelical\" Protestants \u2014 closely watched for their political clout within the GOP \u2014 now account for 19% of American adults, down slightly from 21% in 2007.\n\nPoliticians should take note, said Mike Hout, a sociologist and demographer at New York University who is also a co-director of the General Social Survey.\n\n\"Traditionally, we thought religion was the mover and politics were the consequence,\" he said. Today, it's the opposite.\n\nMany of today's formerly faithful left conservative evangelical or Catholic denominations because \"they saw them align with a conservative political agenda and they don't want to be identified with that,\" Hout said.\n\nCatholics dropped both in market share and in real numbers. Despite their high retention rate for people reared in the faith, they have a low conversion rate. Today, Cooperman said, 13% of U.S. adults are former Catholics, up from 10% in 2007.\n\nGenerational shifts are also hurting Catholic numbers. Greg Smith, Pew's associate director of research, said \"just 16% of the 18-to-24-year-olds today are Catholic, and that is not enough to offset the numbers lost to the aging and switching.\"\n\nWhere are they going? To religious nowhere.\n\nThe \"nones\" \u2014 Americans who are unaffiliated with brand-name religion \u2014 are the new major force in American faith. And they are more secular in outlook \u2014 and \"more comfortable admitting it\" than ever before, said John Green, director of the Bliss Institute of Applied Politics at the University of Akron.\n\nTheir growth spans the generations, as well as racial and ethnic groups, said Green, a senior fellow in religion and American politics for the Pew Research Center.\n\n\"Nones,\" at 22.8% of the U.S. (up from 16% just eight years ago) run second only to evangelicals (25.4%) and ahead of Catholics (20.8%) in religious market share.\n\nThe \"nones\" numbers are now big enough to show noteworthy diversity:\n\nAtheists rose from 1.6% to 3.1%, and agnostics from 2.4% to 4%. Combined, there are more \"nones\" than Evangelical Lutherans, United Methodists and Episcopalians all together.\n\n\"It's because we're right,\" crowed David Silverman, president of American Atheists. He hadn't yet seen the Pew findings, but commented based on other surveys he said showed nones rising numbers. Indeed, it's the public attention given to \"nones\" in the last decade, combined with the wide-open access to anti-religious discussion on the Internet, that drives the change, Silverman said.\n\n\"More people know the facts, and more people realize they are not alone,\" Silverman said. And with these shifts, the stigma of coming out as an atheist is lessening.\n\n\"It's now impossible for an atheist to think he is alone in this world. They are automatically empowered,\" said Silverman.\n\nThe bulk of the \"nones\" (15.8%, up from 12.1% in 2007) don't even commit to any view on God. Instead, they say they believe \"nothing in particular.\"\n\nBut among the \"nothings,\" there's a distinct split between \"spiritual\" and totally indifferent \"nones.\"\n\nThirty percent of all \"nones\" still showed \"a sort of religious pulse\" by saying that religion is still at least somewhat important to them, said Cooperman.\n\nHowever, the bulk of this group (39%) are not agnostic, atheist or vaguely spiritual \u2014 they're just not interested. Religion is not even somewhat important to them.\n\nThat same level of disinterest cuts into their social and political clout, said Hout.\n\nThe nothing-in-particular folks \"don't vote, don't marry and don't have kids,\" at the same rate as other Americans, said Hout. \"They are allergic to large, organized institutions \u2014 mass media, religions, big corporations, and political parties.\"\n\n\"None\" is the winning category for religious switchers across society, particularly among gay and lesbians \u2014 41% of gay or lesbian Americans say they have no religion. Cooperman said. \"This suggests the degree of alienation and discomfort and sense of being unwelcome that they may have felt in traditional religious groups.\"\n\nIntermarriage is rising with each generation. Among Americans who have gotten married since 2010, nearly four-in-ten (39%) report that they are in religiously mixed marriages, compared with 19% among those who got married before 1960, according to the report.\n\nThere's an identity gender gap. Most Christians are women (55%) and most \"nones\" are men (57%).

When Saudi Arabia executed the prominent nonviolent Shia dissident Sheikh Nimr al-Nimr, causing protests throughout the Shia world and inflaming sectarian divisions, The New York Times noted that the Podesta Group provided the newspaper with a Saudi commentator who defended the execution.\u201d \nNotably, the Saudis\u2019 reputation has only worsened as further atrocities pile up \u2014 concerning not only a record number of barbaric beheadings this year, but suspiciously reckless and errant U.S.-backed coalition bombings of civilian sites in several regions of active conflict. \nAdditionally, Tony Podesta\u2019s status as a registered foreign agent for Saudi Arabia is at least obliquely discussed in an email from April 15, 2015 \u2014 ironically revealed by Wikileaks\u2019 publishing of his brothers personal communiques \u2014 in which former Clinton Foundation chief development officer and now campaign national finance director Dennis Cheng wrote to a small group of insiders: \n\u201cHi all \u2013 we do need to make a decision on this ASAP as our friends who happen to be registered with FARA [Foreign Agents Registration Act] are already donating and raising. \n\u201cI do want to push back a bit (it\u2019s my job!): I feel like we are leaving a good amount of money on the table (both for primary and general, and then DNC and state parties)\u2026 and how do we explain to people that we\u2019ll take money from a corporate lobbyist but not them; that the Foundation takes $ from foreign govts but we now won\u2019t. Either way, we need to make a decision soon.\u201d \nTo which general counsel to the Clinton campaign, attorney Marc Elias, replied [all errors original and emphasis added], \n\u201cResponding to all on this. I was not on the call this morning, but I lean away from a bright line rule here. It seems odd to say that someone who represents Alberta, Canada can\u2019t give, but a lobbyist for Phillip Morris can. Just as we vet lobbyists case by case, I would do the same with FARA. While this may lead to a large number of FARA registrants being denied, it would not be a flat our ban. A total ban feels arbitrary and will engender the same eye-rolling and ill will that it did for Obama.\u201d \nAs the exchange continues, how to precisely handle the campaign\u2019s image with potentially controversial donors \u2014 while, at all costs, maintaining the flow of cash \u2014 becomes even more apparent. As strategist and campaign manager Robby Mook responds, \n\u201cWhere do we draw the line though?\u201d \nElias suggests a particularly intricate solution: \n\u201cIf we do it case by case, then it will be subjective. We would look at who the donor is and what foreign entity they are registered for. In judging whether to take the money, we would consider the relationship between that country and the United States, its relationship to the State Department during Hillary\u2019s time as Secretary, and its relationship, if any, to the Foundation. In judging the individual, we would look at their history of support for political candidates generally and Hillary\u2019s past campaigns specifically. \n\u201cPut simply, we would use the same criteria we use for lobbyists, except with a somewhat more stringent screen. \n\u201cAs a legal matter, I am not saying we have to do this \u2013 we can decide to simply ban foreign registrants entirely. I\u2019m just offering this up as a middle ground.\u201d \nMook eventually decides plainly, \n\u201cMarc made a convincing case to me this am that these sorts of restrictions don\u2019t really get you anything\u2026that Obama actually got judged MORE harshly as a result. He convinced me. So\u2026in a complete U-turn, I\u2019m ok just taking the money and dealing with any attacks. Are you guys ok with that?\u201d \nAll of this political wrangling appears to have had the desired effect \u2014 despite increasing calls for the United States to either rein in or sever completely its support for the bloody Saudi regime \u2014 the U.S. approved a stunning $1.29 billion sale of smart bombs to the Kingdom in November 2015. \nTony Podesta\u2019s specific contract with the government-run Center for Studies and Media Affairs at the Saudi Royal Court, which will earn $1.68 million by year\u2019s end, does, indeed, suggest the infusion of a pro-Saudi message into the U.S. media propaganda machine. \n\u201cSaudi Arabia is consistently one of the bigger players when it comes to foreign influence in Washington,\u201d Sunlight Foundation spokesman Josh Stewart told the Washington Post . \u201cThat spans both what you\u2019d call the inside game, which is lobbying and government relations, and the outside game, which is PR and other things that tend to reach a broader audience than just lobbying.\u201d \nThat broader audience \u2014 the American public \u2014 has indeed been manipulated courtesy of at least the thoroughly-corrupt Clinton campaign if not surreptitiously by the Saudis, as well. \nAs The Free Thought Project has repeatedly reported , the evidence of collusion among the Democratic National Committee, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign, and the mainstream presstitutes is indisputable \u2014 including no less than 65 so-called journalists listed by name in various leaks as darlings of the campaign. \nAlthough this level of corruption and collusion would be considered intolerable in nearly any other nation on the planet. And yet, at the center of this shit storm of contention is an official nominee for the White House \u2014 who will not be held responsible for any number of questionable and criminal acts. \nThe system isn\u2019t rigged \u2014 it\u2019s performing exactly as intended \u2014 and always will as long as the vote validates its existence.

Mitt Romney, Republicans' nominee in 2012, announced Friday he would bow out after just three weeks on the presidential speculation treadmill. Three Republican senators, two current governors and one former governor have all made active moves toward campaigns.\n\nThere could be ten or more Republican candidates by this summer. That might be when Hillary Clinton gets around to officially moving toward a campaign, if she heeds some confidantes, who are privately arguing for an announcement in July to coincide with the start of the third fundraising quarter. Delaying until the summer is an idea that is said to be gaining momentum against those who want to stick to the plan for an April start date.\n\nThe possibility of the delay is very real but still unsettled.\n\n\"I would say it's 40 percent,\" in the direction of those arguing for a delay, said one Democrat who supports a spring debut for Clinton's presidential campaign. Another Democrat who saw merits in both time lines put the odds of a delay at 50 percent.\n\nDemocrats on both sides of the debate spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity so they could make their case without upsetting Clinton or those close to her for talking openly about internal deliberations.\n\nSome Clinton loyalists worry that as the increasingly crowded Republican race heats up, the attacks on her could begin to stick without an apparatus in place to answer them.\n\nThe liberal superPAC American Bridge has been countering Republican attacks on Clinton's behalf but many Democrats think it's no substitute for a campaign messaging operation.\n\n\"They're doing terrific research,\" said one, \"but they don't know what her specific policy agenda is going to be. She should get in and start putting together a substantive policy agenda so the attacks that are going to begin to come from every single Republican who is jumping in to the race can be answered.\"\n\nThe Democratic National Committee is beginning to take on a larger role in an effort to protect Clinton and the party brand but many Democrats are concerned even that won't be enough.\n\nOther supporters want Clinton to lay low as the Republican field heats up, convinced Clinton will avoid some fire if she's undeclared and GOP candidates will take aim at each other instead.\n\n\"Never interrupt your opponent when it's destroying itself. That event in Iowa - nobody hated that more than [RNC chairman] Reince Priebus,\" said one Democrat, referring to the recent Iowa Freedom Summit, the first GOP cattle call for prospective candidates of many Republican presidential hopefuls (though noticeably neither Jeb Bush, Mitt Romney nor Rand Paul) attended. \"Let's get Sarah Palin out there, let's get Donald Trump out there - the whole clown car.\"\n\nSome Democrats believe it's also in Clinton's best interest to wait until President Obama, whose approval ratings have begun to rebound, becomes more popular, since a campaign by his former secretary of state will undoubtedly be seen as an extension of his presidency. It's a view shared by many at the White House who eye the entry of Clinton into the 2016 contest as the beginning of Obama's lame duck phase.\n\nBut if Clinton waits, she could run the risk of looking like she's taking the Democratic nomination for granted.\n\n\"The American people don't like to see a candidate assume that something is theirs for the taking,\" warned one Clinton supporter.\n\n\"If [Hillary Clinton] is trying to avoid a coronation it really is a terrible way to go about it. It sends a message that we don't have to campaign in the primaries.\" said a Democratic operative in Iowa, who warned it leaves an opening. \"It really does require another candidate to fill that void\"\n\nAnd so far, no one has.\n\nVice President Joe Biden, former Maryland governor Martin O'Malley, former Virginia Senator Jim Webb and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders have all made the trek to Iowa in the last year, but none are being particularly agressive in recruiting staff or taking on Clinton.\n\n\"O'Malley hired one staff member the other day and that's all anyone is talking about,\" said the Iowa operative of the unusually quiet political scene in the early state. \"It's kinda weird.\"\n\nIn 2008, Clinton's air of inevitability was off putting to many voters. Clinton and her advisers have been looking to avoid it this time around.\n\nBut without an insurgent, Obama-like candidate waiting in the wings (Clinton insiders are now pretty much convinced that populist darling and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren won't run, despite initial concerns she could mount a serious challenge from the left), many loyalists argue Clinton is safe to wait.\n\n\"If she's out there working hard, making her case, speaking to voters, that's what's going to matter,\" said a Washington-based Clinton backer who thinks a delayed campaign launch could benefit her.\n\nIt won't benefit her campaign coffers, however.\n\n\"Money will not flow until she's actually running,\" said one Democrat who cited powerful donor support for a Clinton run but acknowledged, \"People don't give that kind of money on speculation.\"\n\nThe numerous Clinton loyalists interviewed for this piece admit there are arguments for both timelines. But perhaps the most important factor in deciding when to jump in the race is Hillary Clinton's personal inclination to put off campaigning.\n\nThe last time she ran for president, she entered the race in January 2006, almost two years before the election. The Democratic primary contest turned into a bruising slog that she is not eager to repeat.\n\n\"You can't dance in that spotlight for two years,\" a Clinton loyalist said. \"She's not Rand Paul, she's the most famous woman on earth and every move is scrutinized.\"", "279": "American Express disowns Pink Floyd singer Roger Waters because of pro-Palestinian views 11/03/2016 \nMONDOWEISS When it comes to aiding Israeli Apartheid, American Express is just another brick in The Wall, according to a new report. Roger Waters, lead singer behind Pink Floyd, lost a multimillion dollar American Express sponsorship for his 2017 US+Them tour after expressing solidarity this month with Palestinian students trying to end Israel\u2019s apartheid system of military occupation using the same protest tactic that helped dismantle South African Apartheid (and, earlier, America\u2019s Jim Crow): Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions, or BDS. \u201cI\u2019m going to send out all of my most heartfelt love and support to all those young people on the campuses of the universities of California who are standing up for their brothers and sisters in Palestine and supporting the BDS movement,\u201d Rogers said, according to CBS News , \u201cin the hope that we may encourage the government of Israel to end the occupation.\u201d American Express decided it would be a good idea to leak the cancellation of the contract to the New York Post , where Page Six\u2019s Emily Smith has the exclusive story . \u201cRoger is putting on a huge show. The company was asked to sponsor his tour for $4 million, but pulled out because it did not want to be part of his anti-Israel rhetoric,\u201d an American Express spokesman told the paper. \u201cWe never committed to sponsoring Roger Waters\u2019 upcoming tour. When we were approached with the options, we passed on making a bid.\u201d American Express had helped sponsor Waters\u2019 Oldchella Desert Trip festival (Coachella for the senior set featuring Neil Young, Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, and the Rolling Stones) where he made the comments expressing support for human rights. But without anybody even asking them, American Express decided it had to go out of its way to bash Waters for \u201cputting on a huge show.\u201d Noteworthy about American Express\u2019s decision is that it comes even as Waters included more mainstream political views, like featuring in the performance a line of children wearing shirts that said \u201cDerriba el muro,\u201d (Tear down the wall). He also showed Trump in a Klan outfit, and the show featured a floating pig balloon that calls the Republican candidate an \u201cIgnorant, lying, racist, sexist pig,\u201d CBS reported. Waters more mainstream kinds of leftist protest didn\u2019t make up for his audacious display of solidarity with his fellow human beings living and dying under a ceaseless occupation. American Express has also sponsored Beyonce\u2019s performances, where she has used art to make reference to police oppression of communities of color . But AmEx lost its nerve when Waters brought up Palestinian rights. According to the New York Post , Waters has known that there are consequences for standing up against the occupation, and that keeps others silent. \u201cI have been accused of being a Nazi and an anti-Semite for the past 10 years. My industry has been particularly recalcitrant in even raising a voice [against Israel] . . . I\u2019ve talked to a lot of them, and they are scared s \u2013 \u2013 tless. If they say something in public, they will no longer have a career. They will be destroyed,\u201d he said, according to the Post. But Waters is already famous, and 75, so the stakes aren\u2019t the same as for young artists. Update (11/1/16) This article originally quoted the New York Post as saying that Citi had assumed sponsorship of the tour after American Express dropped out, but after publication a representative of Citi contacted us with this clarification: In your article \u201c American Express disowns Pink Floyd singer Roger Waters because of pro-Palestinian views \u201d, it mentions that \u201cCitibank grabbed the opportunity to sponsor one of the biggest and best acts of the 20th century.\u201d However, Citi is not a sponsor of Roger Waters\u2019 upcoming tour. Two weeks ago, Citi offered a limited time pre-sale of tickets for cardmembers for select shows, as we do for thousands of concerts by different artists every year. The pre-sale has ended and we have no plans to work with this artist in the future. \n\u2013 See more at: http://mondoweiss.net/2016/10/american-express-palestinian/#sthash.cGAw7DW9.dpuf", "280": "Clinton said at a campaign event outside St. Louis that the \"ugly, divisive rhetoric we are hearing from Donald Trump and the encouragement of violence and aggression is wrong, and it's dangerous.\"\n\n\"If you play with matches, you're going to start a fire you can't control,\" Clinton said about Trump at a caucus kick-off event at a local YMCA. \"That's not leadership. That's political arson. The test of leadership and citizenship is the opposite. If you see bigotry, oppose it. If you see violence, condemn it. And if you see a bully, stand up to him.\"\n\nClinton acknowledged the \"anger\" that is motivating people on the left and the right of the political divide but said the way to bridge the gap \"is to stand together against the forces of division and discrimination that are trying to divide America between us and them.\"\n\nClinton, the Democratic front-runner, has made knocking Trump a regular part of her stump speech, blasting the businessman for comments he has made against Mexicans, women and Muslims. She regularly touts herself as the first candidate to call out his rhetoric.\n\nBut at the outset of the Republican race, many inside Clinton's campaign saw Trump as an interesting sideshow, not someone who could credibly capture the Republican nomination. That has changed. Clinton's top aides now view Trump as the favorite to win the Republican nomination, and Clinton has started to go after the brash billionaire with more directness. \"You don't get the chance to make America great by getting rid of everything that made America great,\" Clinton said, parroting Trump's campaign slogan. \"No, our values, our diversity, our openness, these are strengths, not weaknesses.\"", "281": "They tease terrorists. The prophet Muhammad cries. A devout Muslim woman shows some leg, and more. They take on Pope Francis, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French Prime Minister Manuel Valls. There are nuns, priests, rabbis and imams. They laugh at death itself.\n\nThe latest edition of Charlie Hebdo, the satirical newspaper attacked last week by Islamist extremists for lampooning the prophet Muhammad, became a symbol of freedom of expression as soon as it hit newsstands Wednesday \u2014 selling out millions of copies before dawn. Yet, in a country that mobilized Sunday by the millions in support of the paper\u2019s right to mock, France also found itself facing a mounting debate over the limits of free speech within its borders.\n\nFrench authorities on Wednesday detained and charged a notorious comedian, Dieudonn\u00e9 M\u2019bala M\u2019bala, with \u201cglorifying terrorism\u201d for an ambiguous Facebook post Sunday that, to some, appeared to show support for the gunman who killed four people in a kosher market Friday.\n\nSince last week\u2019s attacks, at least 54 people have faced similar charges \u2014 including several underage pranksters and drunken louts who were mouthing off. Authorities have used a beefed up anti-terrorism law passed last year to expedite their cases and issue harsher jail sentences \u2014 with one offender arrested Saturday already receiving a four-year sentence. The Justice Ministry has also issued fresh orders for prosecutors to crack down on \u201canti-Semitic and racist acts or speech.\u201d\n\nLaurent L\u00e9ger, an investigative journalist for Charlie Hebdo who survived the attack, said there was no comparing the newspaper to Dieudonn\u00e9 \u2014 a French showman of Cameroonian descent who popularized a Nazi-like salute and who jokes about the Holocaust.\n\n\u201cDieudonn\u00e9 does not know the Charlie spirit,\u201d L\u00e9ger said. \u201cCharlie never glorified terrorism. Dieudonn\u00e9 is a bit too quick when he claims that his freedom of speech is being hampered. His attitude is just making things worse by continuing the confusion that is destroying this country.\u201d\n\nYet others disagreed, saying France was in danger of trouncing the very right it is aiming to protect: freedom of expression.\n\n\u201cWe can definitely talk about hypocrisy here,\u201d said Adrienne Charmet, campaign coordinator for La Quadrature du Net, a Paris-based Internet rights group. \u201cIn the past days, we have seen a lot of people condemned for putting out words, no matter how condemnable those words, and receiving sentences that seem quite exaggerated.\u201d\n\n\u201cFrench opinion is split in two,\u201d she added. \u201cSome see it as the worst possible response to last week\u2019s attack, because many of those who have said these things were drunk, or teenagers, who did not know the weight of their words. But there is another segment of the population that does agree, because they feel these people are making themselves accomplices to terror. Either way, this crackdown on freedom of speech is a betrayal of last Sunday\u2019s march.\u201d\n\nCharlie Hebdo was undoubtedly the hottest property in town Wednesday, with lines snaking for blocks as Parisians clamored for copies that sold out within minutes. An initial print run of 3\u00a0million copies was expanded to 5\u00a0million when kiosks across the country ran out.\n\nSurviving staff members, who worked day and night after the Jan. 7 attack to ensure the issue came out on time, produced the paper. With their offices still roped off as a crime scene, the staff worked out of a conference room at the left-wing daily Lib\u00e9ration. The offices there are being guarded around the clock by an extraordinary number of police officers and private security guards.\n\nThere was plenty inside the paper to stir controversy. The 16-page edition brims with the sort of irreverent, off-color humor that made Charlie famous \u2014 and infamous. No one is spared ridicule.\n\nIn one cartoon, two hooded terrorists are pictured in heaven, with one asking the other, \u201cWhere are the virgins?\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re with the Charlie staff, loser,\u201d his accomplice replies.\n\nAnother pictures a harried and exhausted cartoonist hunched over his desk, with a caption that reads, \u201cCartooning at Charlie Hebdo, it\u2019s 25 years of work.\u201d The next panel shows hooded gunmen mowing people down with a Kalashnikov, accompanied by the words, \u201cFor a terrorist, it\u2019s 25 seconds of work.\u201d\n\nAs ever with Charlie Hebdo, the goal is to provoke, to stir debate and to make people laugh \u2014 while also reminding anyone who might think otherwise that reading Charlie can be distinctly discomfiting.\n\nThe paper\u2019s lead editorial offers a vigorous defense of secular values, saying that staffers laughed when they heard that the bells of the Cathedral of Notre Dame would ring in their honor.\n\n\u201cThe millions of anonymous people, all the institutions, all the world leaders, all the politicians, all the intellectuals and media figures, all the religious dignitaries who proclaimed this week that \u2018I am Charlie\u2019 need to also know that that means, \u2018I am secularism,\u2019\u2009\u201d the editorial says.\n\nDelphine Ravion-Casalta, 39, spent an hour and a half visiting three newsstands Wednesday morning before she found her Charlie. She sipped coffee at a cafe, her copy proudly spread out before her, eagerly taking in every word.\n\n\u201cIn France, we\u2019re still fighting for our freedom,\u201d she said. \u201cWe had revolution for our freedom. A lot of revolutions. And great men like Voltaire and Rousseau. The fight for those ideas continues.\u201d\n\nThe rush for copies of Charlie Hebdo came as French authorities detained and charged Dieudonn\u00e9, 48. After the unity march that brought 1.5\u00a0million people onto the streets of Paris on Sunday, the comedian wrote: \u201cAfter this historic, no legendary, march, a magic moment equal to the Big Bang which created the Universe, or in a smaller way comparable to the crowning of the [ancient king] Vercing\u00e9torix, I am going home. Let me say that this evening, as far as I am concerned, I feel I am Charlie Coulibaly.\u201d\n\nCharlie Coulibaly is a reference to both Charlie Hebdo and Amedy Coulibaly, the gunman who killed four people in a Paris kosher market on Friday. The comedian, in a second Facebook post Monday, sought to clarify his remark, saying his purpose was \u201cto make people laugh, and to laugh at death, since death makes fun of us all, as Charlie very well knows.\u201d He concluded by saying, \u201cThey consider me to be Amedy Coulibaly when I am no different from a Charlie.\u201d\n\nValls, speaking in the National Assembly, sought to draw a distinction between the creative caricatures of Charlie Hebdo and the comedian\u2019s hate-based humor, while insisting that France was not compromising freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cThere is a fundamental difference between the freedom to be impertinent, and anti-Semitism, racism, glorification of terrorist acts and Holocaust denial, all of which are offenses, all of which are crimes, that justice should punish with the most severity,\u201d he said.", "282": " President-Elect Donald Trump's First Televised Interview Video CBS 60 Minutes Trump Talks Wall, Deportations, Roe v.

Do you regret any of the things you said about her?\nDonald Trump: Well, it was a double-side nasty.\nDonald Trump: I mean they were tough and I was tough and-- do I regret? I mean, I\u0092m sitting here with you now and we\u0092re gonna do a great job for the country. We\u0092re going to make America great again, I mean, that\u0092s what-- it-- it began with that and that\u0092s where we are right now. There are so many--\nLesley Stahl: So no-- no regrets about--\nDonald Trump: I can\u0092t regret. No-- I wish it were softer, I wish it were nicer, I wish maybe even it was more on policy, or whatever you want to say. But-- but I will say that-- it really-- it really is something that I\u0092m very proud of I mean it was a tremendous campaign.\nLesley Stahl: Can we talk about yesterday with President Obama?\nDonald Trump: Sure.\nLesley Stahl: 90 minutes. You were scheduled for what? 15?\nDonald Trump: 15 max.\n[Barack Obama: We talked about foreign policy, we talked about domestic policy.]\nDonald Trump: This was just going to be a quick little chat and it lasted close to an hour and a half. And it could have gone on for four hours. I mean it was-- just-- in fact, it was almost hard breaking it up because we had so many things to say. And he told me-- the good things and the bad things, there are things that are tough right now--\nLesley Stahl: Like what?\nDonald Trump: Well\nLesley Stahl: Give us some meat.\nDonald Trump: Well, look I don\u0092t want to divulge, but we talked about the Middle East, that\u0092s tough. It\u0092s a tough situation. I wanted to get his full view and I got his, you know I got a good part of his view.\nLesley Stahl: Uh-huh.\nDonald Trump: And I like having that because I\u0092m going to be inheriting that in a short period of time. I found him to be terrific. I found him to be-- very smart and very nice. Great sense of humor, as much as you can have a sense of humor talking about tough subjects, but we were talking about some pretty tough subjects.\nDonald Trump:\u0096and we were talking about some victories, also, some things that-- that he feels very good about. But--\nLesley Stahl: Like--\nDonald Trump: Well, what I really wanted to focus on was-- the Middle East, North Korea, Obamacare is tough. You know, healthcare is a tough situation.\nLesley Stahl: Oh, I bet he asked you not to undo it.\nDonald Trump: Well, he didn\u0092t ask me, no, he told me-- you know, the merits and the difficulties. And we understand that.\nLesley Stahl: You looked pretty sober sitting there in the Oval Office, did something wash over you or--\nDonald Trump: No, I think I\u0092m a sober person. I think the press tries to make you into something a little bit different. In my case, a little bit of a wild man. I\u0092m not. I\u0092m actually not. I\u0092m a very sober person. But it was respect for the office, it was respect for the president. Again, I never met him before, but we had-- we had a very good chemistry going. And-- and I really found\u0097it might not be that I agree with him, but I really found the conversation unbelievably interesting.\n[Barack Obama: I want to emphasize to you, Mr. President-elect, that we now are gonna want to do everything we can to help you succeed, because if you succeed then the country succeeds.]\nLesley Stahl: Was it at all awkward, at all, given what you\u0092ve said about each other? You said he was not born in this country, he said things about you, he said you\u0092re-- unqualified--\nDonald Trump: You know what, it was a very-- it was a very interesting thing because-- I mean, few people have asked me from my family, what was that first period of time like?\nLesley Stahl: Yeah.\nDonald Trump: We never discussed what was said about each other. I said terrible things about him, he said terrible things about me. We never ever discussed what we said about each other\u0097\nLesley Stahl: There was no awkwardness?\nDonald Trump: I\u0092ll be honest, from my standpoint zero, zero. And that\u0092s strange. I\u0092m actually surprised to tell you that. It\u0092s-- you know, a little bit strange.\n[Donald Trump: Thank you, sir.]\nLesley Stahl: Do you think that-- that your election is a repudiation of his presidency?\nDonald Trump: No, I think it\u0092s a moment in time where politicians for a long period of time have let people down. They\u0092ve let \u0091em down on the job front. They\u0092ve even let \u0091em down in terms of the war front. You know, we\u0092ve been fighting this war for 15 years--\nLesley Stahl: This was the message of your campaign.\nDonald Trump: We\u0092ve spent $6 trillion in the Middle East, $6 trillion, we could have rebuilt our country twice. And you look at our roads and our bridges and our tunnels and all of the-- and our airports are, like, obsolete. And I think it was just a repudiation of what\u0092s been taking place over a longer period of time than that.\nLesley Stahl: You know, you surprised everyone by winning the primaries, beating 17 other Republicans or 16, whatever-- people are really surprised that you won this election. Are people going to be surprised about how you conduct yourself as president?\nDonald Trump: You know, I\u0092ll conduct myself-- in a very good manner, but depends on what the situation is, sometimes you have to be rougher. When I look at-- when I look at the world and you look at how various places are taking advantage of our country, and I say it, and I say it very proudly, it\u0092s going to be America first. It\u0092s not going to be what we\u0092re doing\u0097we, we\u0092ve lost-- we\u0092re losing this country. We\u0092re losing this country. That\u0092s why I won the election. And by the way, won it easily, I mean I won easily. That was big, big.\n Lesley Stahl: Are you going to sometimes have that same rhetoric that you had on the stump? Or are you going to reign it in?\n Donald Trump: Well, sometimes you need a certain rhetoric to get people motivated. I don\u0092t want to be just a little nice monotone character and in many cases I will be.\nLesley Stahl: Can you be?\nDonald Trump: Sure I can. I can be easily, that\u0092s easier. Honestly to do that, it\u0092s easier.\nLesley Stahl: So let\u0092s go through very quickly some of the promises you made and tell us if you\u0092re going to do what you said or you\u0092re going to change it in any way. Are you really going to build a wall?\n Donald Trump: Yes.\nLesley Stahl: They\u0092re talking about a fence in the Republican Congress, would you accept a fence?\nDonald Trump: For certain areas I would, but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate. I\u0092m very good at this, it\u0092s called construction.\nLesley Stahl: So part wall, part fence?\nDonald Trump: Yeah, it could be \u0096 it could be some fencing.\nLesley Stahl: What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?\nDonald Trump: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably two million, it could be even three million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate. But we\u0092re getting them out of our country, they\u0092re here illegally. After the border is secured and after everything gets normalized, we\u0092re going to make a determination on the people that you\u0092re talking about who are terrific people, they\u0092re terrific people but we are gonna make a determination at that-- But before we make that determination-- Lesley, it\u0092s very important, we want to secure our border.\n[Paul Ryan: We had a fantastic, productive meeting.]\nLesley Stahl: So you were with Paul Ryan, you met with the Republican leadership, what was the-- one thing that you all agreed you want to get done right away?\nDonald Trump: Well, I would say there was more than one thing, there were three things, it was healthcare, there was immigration and there was a major tax bill lowering taxes in this country. We\u0092re going to substantially simplify and lower the taxes--\nLesley Stahl: And you\u0092ve got both Houses?\nDonald Trump: And I have both Houses and we have the presidency, so we can do things--\nLesley Stahl: You can do things lickety-split.\nDonald Trump: It\u0092s been a long time since it\u0092s happened.\nDonald Trump: And they gave me a lot of credit. Don\u0092t forget, I was abused four or five weeks ago, they said I was going to-- instead of having all three, we would lose all three. So that was good. But those are the three things that we really discussed.\nLesley Stahl: You said that lobbyists owned politicians because they give them money.\nDonald Trump: Yeah.\nLesley Stahl: You admitted you used to do it yourself. You have a transition team\u0097\nDonald Trump: And when you say lobbyists, lobbyists and special interests.\n Lesley Stahl: And you want to get rid of all of that?\n Donald Trump: I don\u0092t like it, no.\n Lesley Stahl: You don\u0092t like it, but your own transition team, it\u0092s filled with lobbyists.\n Donald Trump: That\u0092s the only people you have down there.\n Lesley Stahl: You have lobbyists from Verizon, you have lobbyists from the oil gas industry, you have food lobby.\nDonald Trump: Sure. Everybody\u0092s a lobbyist down there--\n Lesley Stahl: Well, wait\n Donald Trump: That\u0092s what they are. They\u0092re lobbyists or special interests\u0097\nLesley Stahl: On your own transition team.\n Donald Trump:\u0096we are trying to clean up Washington. Look--\n Lesley Stahl: How can you claim--\n Donald Trump: Everything, everything down there-- there are no people-- there are all people that work -- that\u0092s the problem with the system, the system. Right now, we\u0092re going to clean it up. We\u0092re having restrictions on foreign money coming in, we\u0092re going to put on term limits, which a lot of people aren\u0092t happy about, but we\u0092re putting on term limits. We\u0092re doing a lot of things to clean up the system. But everybody that works for government, they then leave government and they become a lobbyist, essentially. I mean, the whole place is one big lobbyist.\nLesley Stahl: But you\u0092re, but you\u0092re basically saying you have to rely on them, even though you want to get rid of them?\nDonald Trump: I\u0092m saying that they know the system right now, but we\u0092re going to phase that out. You have to phase it out.\n Lesley Stahl: Let\u0092s talk about your cabinet.\n Donald Trump: OK.\n Lesley Stahl: Have you made any decisions?\n Donald Trump: Yes.\nLesley Stahl: Tell us.\nDonald Trump: Well, I can\u0092t tell you that, but I have made--\nLesley Stahl: Oh, come on\u0097\nDonald Trump: You know the amazing thing to show you the incredible nature of our country. First of all, every major leader and probably less than major le- has called me, I\u0092ve spoken to many of them and I\u0092ll call the rest of them, but and I said, \u0093Boy, this really shows you how powerful our country is.\u0094 France and U.K. and I mean everybody, all over Asia\u0097and very, just to congratulate. But it really shows the power of our country.\nLesley Stahl: One of the things you\u0092re going to obviously get an opportunity to do, is name someone to the Supreme Court. And I assume you\u0092ll do that quickly?\nDonald Trump: Yes. Very important.\nLesley Stahl: During the campaign, you said that you would appoint justices who were against abortion rights. Will you appoint-- are you looking to appoint a justice who wants to overturn Roe v. Wade?\nDonald Trump: So look, here\u0092s what\u0092s going to happen-- I\u0092m going to-- I\u0092m pro-life. The judges will be pro-life. They\u0092ll be very\u0097\nLesley Stahl: But what about overturning this law--\nDonald Trump: Well, there are a couple of things. They\u0092ll be pro-life, they\u0092ll be-- in terms of the whole gun situation, we know the Second Amendment and everybody\u0092s talking about the Second Amendment and they\u0092re trying to dice it up and change it, they\u0092re going to be very pro-Second Amendment. But having to do with abortion if it ever were overturned, it would go back to the states. So it would go back to the states and--\n Lesley Stahl: Yeah, but then some women won\u0092t be able to get an abortion?\n Donald Trump: No, it\u0092ll go back to the states.\nLesley Stahl: By state\u0097no some --\n Donald Trump: Yeah.\n Donald Trump: Yeah, well, they\u0092ll perhaps have to go, they\u0092ll have to go to another state.\n Lesley Stahl: And that\u0092s OK?\nDonald Trump: Well, we\u0092ll see what happens. It\u0092s got a long way to go, just so you understand. That has a long, long way to go.\n Lesley Stahl: Are you in any way intimidated, scared about this enormous burden, the gravity of what you\u0092re taking on?\n Donald Trump: No.\n Lesley Stahl: Not at all?\n Donald Trump: I respect it. But I\u0092m not scared by it.\nLesley Stahl: Now you\u0092re not scared, but there are people, Americans, who are scared and some of them are demonstrating right now, demonstrating against you, against your rhetoric--\nDonald Trump: That\u0092s only because they don\u0092t know me. I really believe that\u0092s only because--\nLesley Stahl: Well, they listened to you in the campaign and that\u0092s--\nDonald Trump: I just don\u0092t think they know me.\n Lesley Stahl: Well, what do you think they\u0092re demonstrating against?\nDonald Trump: Well, I think in some cases, you have professional protesters. And we had it-- if you look at WikiLeaks, we had--\n Lesley Stahl: You think those people down there are\u0097\n Donald Trump: Well Lesley\u0097\n Lesley Stahl: are professional?\n Donald Trump: Oh, I think some of them will be professional, yeah--\nLesley Stahl: OK, but what about \u0096 they\u0092re in every city.\nLesley Stahl: When they demonstrate against you and there are signs out there, I mean, don\u0092t you say to yourself, I guess you don\u0092t, you know, do I have to worry about this? Do I have to go out and assuage them? Do I have to tell them not to be afraid? They\u0092re afraid.\n Donald Trump: I would tell them don\u0092t be afraid, absolutely.\nLesley Stahl: But that\u0092s not what you\u0092re saying, I said it-\n Donald Trump: Oh, I think, no, no, I think-- I am saying it, I\u0092ve been saying it.\n Lesley Stahl: OK.\nDonald Trump: Don\u0092t be afraid. We are going to bring our country back. But certainly, don\u0092t be afraid. You know, we just had an election and sort of like you have to be given a little time. I mean, people are protesting. If Hillary had won and if my people went out and protested, everybody would say, \u0093Oh, that\u0092s a terrible thing.\u0094 And it would have been a much different attitude. There is a different attitude. You know, there is a double standard here.\nIt has been five full days since the election and anti-Trump demonstrations, driven in part by Hillary Clinton\u0092s edge in the popular vote, have been significant.\nWhen we interviewed him on Friday afternoon Mr. Trump said he had not heard about some of the acts of violence that are popping up in his name or against his supporters.\nNor he said had he heard about reports of racial slurs and personal threats against African Americans, Latinos and gays by some of his supporters.\nDonald Trump: I am very surprised to hear that-- I hate to hear that, I mean I hate to hear that--\nLesley Stahl: But you do hear it?\nDonald Trump: I don\u0092t hear it\u0097I saw, I saw one or two instances\nLesley Stahl: On social media?\nDonald Trump: But I think it\u0092s a very small amount. Again, I think it\u0092s--\nLesley Stahl: Do you want to say anything to those people?\nDonald Trump: I would say don\u0092t do it, that\u0092s terrible, \u0091cause I\u0092m gonna bring this country together.\n Lesley Stahl: They\u0092re harassing Latinos, Muslims--\nDonald Trump: I am so saddened to hear that. And I say, \u0093Stop it.\u0094 If it-- if it helps. I will say this, and I will say right to the cameras: Stop it.\nDuring the campaign Mr. Trump said he would appoint a special prosecutor to look into Hillary Clinton\u0092s email issue.\nSo we asked him if he plans to carry that out.\nThat part of the interview and a discussion with the next first lady, Melania Trump, when we come back.\nOn Friday, Donald Trump announced that he was changing the head of his transition team. Governor Chris Christie was replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Mr. Trump also added his three older children to the transition team.\nBetween now and Inauguration Day, the team must fill the new administration with 4,000 political appointees. That\u0092s 4,000 new hires in just nine weeks.\nWhen we talked to Donald Trump on Friday, the enormity and gravity of his new role was just sinking in. He was subdued. We wondered if as president he planned to temper his rhetoric, lower the flame.\nLesley Stahl: I want to ask you about the tweet that you put out, I think it was last night or the night before, about these demonstrators.\nDonald Trump: Yeah.\nLesley Stahl: You said that they were professionals\u0097and you said it was unfair.\nDonald Trump: I said some of them. Some of them are --\nLesley Stahl: But are you going to be tweeting and whatever you\u0092re upset about just put out there when you\u0092re president?\nDonald Trump: So it\u0092s a modern form of communication, between Face-- you know, Facebook and Twitter and I guess Instagram, I have 28 million people. 28 million people--\nLesley Stahl: So you are going to keep it up?\nDonald Trump: It\u0092s a great form of communication. Now, do I say I\u0092ll give it up entirely and throw out, that\u0092s a tremendous form-- I pick up-- I\u0092m picking up now, I think I picked up yesterday 100,000 people. I\u0092m not saying I love it, but it does get the word out. When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story or when somebody other than you and another network, or whatever, \u0091cause of course, CBS would never do a thing like that right? I have a method of fighting back. That\u0092s very tough--\nLesley Stahl: But you\u0092re going to do that as president?\nDonald Trump: I\u0092m going to do very restrained, if I use it at all, I\u0092m going to do very restrained. I find it tremendous. It\u0092s a modern form of communication. There should be nothing you should be ashamed of. It\u0092s-- it\u0092s where it\u0092s at. I-- I do believe this, I really believe that, um-- the fact that I have such power in terms of numbers with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, et cetera, I think it helped me win all of these races where they\u0092re spending much more money than I spent. You know, I spent my money. A lot of my money. And I won. I think that social media has more power than the money they spent, and I think maybe to a certain extent, I proved that.\nLesley Stahl: Are you going to ask for a special prosecutor to investigate Hillary Clinton over her emails? And are you, as you had said to her face, going to try and put her in jail?\nDonald Trump: Well, I\u0092ll tell you what I\u0092m going to do, I\u0092m going to think about it. Um, I feel that I want to focus on jobs, I want to focus on healthcare, I want to focus on the border and immigration and doing a really great immigration bill. We want to have a great immigration bill. And I want to focus on all of these other things that we\u0092ve been talking about.\nLesley Stahl: You-- you know, you--\nDonald Trump: And get the country straightened away.\nLesley Stahl: You called her \u0093crooked Hillary,\u0094 said you wanted to get in jail, your people in your audiences kept saying, \u0093Lock em\u0092 up.\u0094\nDonald Trump: Yeah. She did--\nLesley Stahl: Do you\u0097\nDonald Trump: She did some bad things, I mean she did some bad things--\nLesley Stahl: I know, but a special prosecutor? You think you might\nDonald Trump: I don\u0092t want to hurt them. I don\u0092t want to hurt them. They\u0092re, they\u0092re good people. I don\u0092t want to hurt them. And I will give you a very, very good and definitive answer the next time we do 60 Minutes together.\nWith that\n[Donald Trump: You look great, honey.]\nWe were joined by the next first lady, Melania Trump. She\u0092ll be only the second foreign-born first lady. She\u0092s from Slovenia. John Quincy Adams\u0092 wife Louisa was the first.\nLesley Stahl: You know, I asked your husband if he was at all intimidated and scared about what lies ahead. The enormity. You\u0092re about to be first lady. Are you a little nervous about it? Little tense? A little--\nMelania Trump: Well, there is a lot of responsibilities. And it\u0092s-- a lot of work needs to be done. And-- it\u0092s-- your-- stuff on your shoulders. And-- we will take care of it-- day by day. I will stay true to myself. I\u0092m very strong and um-- tough and confident. And I will listen myself and I will do what is right and what feels to my heart.\nLesley Stahl: What kind of a first lady do you think she\u0092s going to be?\nDonald Trump: She will be terrific. She is very strong and very confident, but she\u0092s very warm. And I think she\u0092ll have a platform where she\u0092ll really be able to do a lot of good. And that\u0092s what she wants to do.\nLesley Stahl: You know, first ladies usually have a cause. And you\u0092ve already said you\u0092re interested in speaking out against bullying on social media.\nMelania Trump: I think it\u0092s very important because a lot of children and teenagers are getting hurt. And we need to teach them how to talk to each other, how to treat each other and to, to be able to connect with each other on the right way.\nIt\u0092s an ironic choice since her own husband sent out a stream of pretty nasty tweets during the campaign.\nLesley Stahl: What about your husband\u0092s tweeting?\nMelania Trump: Well, sometimes he-- it got him in trouble. But it helped a lot as well. He had unbelievable following.\nLesley Stahl: So you never say to him, \u0093Come on\u0094?\nMelania Trump: I did.\nDonald Trump: She does--\nMelania Trump: I--\nMelania Trump: You know, of course, I did many times, from the beginning of the campaign. But\nLesley Stahl: Does he listen to you?\nMelania Trump: Sometimes he listens, sometimes he doesn\u0092t--\nDonald Trump: I\u0092m not a big tweeter. I mean, I don\u0092t do too many, but they hit home. And they have to get a point across.\nLesley Stahl: If he does something that you think crossed a line, will you tell him?\nMelania Trump: Yes, I tell him all the time.\nLesley Stahl: All the time?\nMelania Trump: All the time.\nLesley Stahl: And does--\nMelania Trump: And--\nLesley Stahl: --he listen? Does he--\nMelania Trump: I think he hears me. But he will do what he wants to do on the end. He\u0092s an adult. He knows the consequences. And I give him my opinion. And he could do whatever he likes with it.\nLesley Stahl: Did you ask Melania sort of, for permission, in a way, to run for president? Did you get her approval?\nDonald Trump: Well, I actually sat down with Melania and my whole family and we talked about it. Don, Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany. Barron to a lesser extent, but Barron too. Um, because in a way he\u0092s affected every bit as much. Maybe more.\nLesley Stahl: Maybe more.\nDonald Trump: And so we all had a dinner and I said, \u0093I would like to do this. I think I can do a great job.\u0094 And I wanted to get, number one, a consensus and number two, ideally, their permission. And they all agreed.\nLesley Stahl: Your son Barron, what is he, 10?\nMelania Trump: 10.\nLesley Stahl: 10. He was on camera the whole time you were giving your acceptance speech. Does he get it? Does he know?\nMelania Trump: He knows. He knows--\nLesley Stahl: He knows?\nMelania Trump: --what\u0092s going on. And, he\u0092s very proud of his dad.\nLesley Stahl: Now-- you met with Michelle Obama yesterday. Was there any awkwardness, given--\nMelania Trump: No.\nLesley Stahl: --what everybody was saying about everybody in the campaign?\nMelania Trump: No. I didn\u0092t feel it.\nLesley Stahl: Not at all?\nMelania Trump: No.\nLesley Stahl: Tell us about the meeting.\nMelania Trump: Yes, she was a gracious host. We had a great time and we talk about raising children in the White House. She was very warm and very nice.\nLesley Stahl: You know, she raised the two kids in the White House. But she had her mother living there. That\u0092s an enormous help. Your parents are here, right?\nMelania Trump: They\u0092re here.\nLesley Stahl: Will they go to Washington with you?\nMelania Trump: They might. We will see. We will discuss that.\nLesley Stahl: Are you prepared, both of you, for the lack of privacy and the intense scrutiny? And you know, first ladies are really criticized if one little hair\u0092s out of place. Are you both prepared for this?\nMelania Trump: We are used to it.\nDonald Trump: I will say, it is on a different scale now, \u0091cause I\u0092ve had a lot. But I\u0092ve never had anything like this.\nLesley Stahl: You won\u0092t be able to walk down the street--\nMelania Trump: I didn\u0092t do that for two years already, so you know, it will just continue. It\u0092s another level, but it will continue.\nAt that point, the discussion turned back to some of the thornier issues Mr. Trump faces.\nLesley Stahl: FBI director James Comey. Are you going to ask for his resignation?\nDonald Trump: I think that I would rather not comment on that yet. I don\u0092t-- I haven\u0092t made up my mind. I respect him a lot. I respect the FBI a lot. I think --\nLesley Stahl: Even though they leak so much?\nDonald Trump: Well, there\u0092s been a lotta leaking, there\u0092s no question about that. But I would certainly like to talk to him. And see him. This is a tough time for him. And I would like to talk to him before I\u0092d answer a question like that.\nLesley Stahl: Sounds like you\u0092re not sure.\nDonald Trump: Well, sure, I\u0092m not sure. I\u0092d wanna see, you know, he may have had very good reasons for doing what he did.\nLesley Stahl: Are you gonna release your tax returns?\nDonald Trump: At the appropriate time, I will release them. But right now I\u0092m under routine audit. Nobody cares. The only one who cares is, you know, you and a few people that asked that question. Obviously, the public didn\u0092t care because I won the election very easily. So they don\u0092t care. I never thought they did care.\nLesley Stahl: Now, for months, you were running around saying that the system is rigged, the whole thing was rigged. You tweeted once that the Electoral College is a disaster for democracy.\nDonald Trump: I do.\nLesley Stahl: So do you still think it\u0092s rigged?\nDonald Trump: Well, I think the electoral ca-- look, I won with the Electoral College.\nLesley Stahl: Exactly.But do you think--\nDonald Trump: You know, it\u0092s--\nLesley Stahl: --it\u0092s rigged?\nDonald Trump: Yeah, some of the election locations are. Some of the system is. I hated--\nLesley Stahl: Even though you won you\u0092re saying that--\nDonald Trump: I hated-- well, you know, I\u0092m not going to change my mind just because I won. But I would rather see it where you went with simple votes. You know, you get 100 million votes and somebody else gets 90 million votes and you win. There\u0092s a reason for doing this because it brings all the states into play. Electoral College and there\u0092s something very good about that. But this is a different system. But I respect it. I do respect the system.\nLesley Stahl: What about vacations? You\u0092re not going to take any vacations? You\u0092ve said that.\nDonald Trump: We have so much work. There\u0092s so much work to be done. And I want to get it done for the people. I want to get it done. We\u0092re lowering taxes, we\u0092re taking care of health care. I mean, there\u0092s just so much to be done. So I don\u0092t think we\u0092ll be very big on vacations, no.\nLesley Stahl: Are you gonna take the salary, the president\u0092s salary?\nDonald Trump: Well, I\u0092ve never commented on this, but the answer is no. I think I have to by law take $1, so I\u0092ll take $1 a year. But it\u0092s a -- I don\u0092t even know what it is.\nDonald Trump: Do you know what the salary is?\nLesley Stahl: $400,000 you\u0092re giving up.\nDonald Trump: No, I\u0092m not gonna take the salary. I\u0092m not taking it.\nIn a moment, the Trump children join us and we will ask the president-elect where he stands on gay marriage, Obamacare, and ISIS.\nOn Tuesday, Donald Trump reached deep into America\u0092s ranks of the discouraged and neglected, a largely white constituency. They feel their America hasn\u0092t been great for a long time. And they accepted a promise to make it great again.\nBut Mr. Trump\u0092s appeal wasn\u0092t just to the disaffected. A map on election night was a sea of red, as he won support across the traditionally Republican South, but also deep into what used to be the blue wall of the Midwest.\nHillary Clinton came up short among her own supporters in large cities and affluent suburbs, among minorities and especially women. Just 51 percent of college-educated white women voted to make her the first female president. Her base didn\u0092t come with the enthusiasm and the turnout she needed to fend off Donald Trump\u0092s new and energized coalition.\nOn Friday Mr. Trump\u0092s four older children \u0096 Tiffany, Donald, Jr., Eric And Ivanka -- joined us to talk about their father\u0092s surprising victory.\nLesley Stahl: Set the scene. It\u0092s election night. Your father-- no one\u0092s expecting him to win and it begins to dawn on you. Tell us about being in that room.\nEric Trump: You start to see the states falling. You start seeing Florida come in and he was declared the winner. And then you saw Ohio, you saw North Carolina. You saw Pennsylvania. You saw Wisconsin. I mean, you saw all these great states \u0096 they\u0092re all falling. And I think it was when we got Pennsylvania that we knew. And it was amazing. We were high fiving and we were all hugging as a family. And I actually think our father was the calmest of all of us even though he was really obviously the center of attention. So--\nLesley Stahl: He went quiet is what I heard.\nEric Trump: --it\u0092s-- it\u0092s--\nLesley Stahl: --is what I heard.\nEric Trump: --it\u0092s a moment I\u0092ll never forget, I can tell you that. I mean, the team was around and everybody\u0092s cheering. And it was just-- it was-- it was a beautiful night.\nIvanka Trump: It is hard to put into words the experience or the emotion when your father becomes president of the United States of America. We had enormous pride, joy. It\u0092s incredibly exciting. And we\u0092re very grateful for the opportunity. And we take that opportunity very seriously.\nLesley Stahl: Tiffany?\nTiffany Trump: I mean I don\u0092t think we can really prepare for our father becoming president. But we were all there together with everyone that\u0092s worked so hard. And my dad has worked so hard. And it\u0092s just \u0096 it\u0092s really awe-inspiring.\nAt some point that night and into the next day, calls from well-wishers started pouring in \u0096 including, Mr. Trump told us, from both ex-presidents Bush. Neither of whom supported him in the campaign.\nLesley Stahl: What did the b=Bushes say when they called you?\nDonald Trump: Well, it was very interesting. I got a call from Father Bush, who is a wonderful man. And he just said, \u0093Congratulations. It was an amazing campaign.\u0094 And then I got a call from George and he said-- \u0093Congratulations. It was great.\u0094 And, you know, look, it\u0092s-- it\u0092s a tough situation. I went to war with Jeb. And Jeb\u0092s a nice guy, but it was a nasty campaign. It was a nasty campaign. And, I mean, I\u0092m disappointed in one thing. He signed a pledge and I don\u0092t know how you sign a pledge and then you don\u0092t honor it. It was a rough primary. It\u0092s a rough primary. Although I think the general was probably just as tough. Probably as a combination, it was the roughest ever.\nLesley Stahl: Ivanka, you said that your father\u0092s changed in the campaign. How has he changed?\nIvanka Trump: I think it\u0092s impossible to go through this journey and not change for the better. You meet-- and in my father\u0092s case, literally millions of Americans, and they speak to you with a candor about their struggles, their challenges. They share with you their most intimate stories. So you connect with people in a different way. And you grow.\nLesley Stahl: Do you think your father\u0092s changed?\nEric Trump: I think as a family, we\u0092ve changed, to tell you the truth. I mean, how big this platform is, is incredible. And I have to say, one of the most rewarding things of my life, and I can speak on behalf of really all of us, it\u0092s fighting by our father\u0092s side every single day as you\u0092ve gone through a grueling, grueling process like this.\nLesley Stahl: Don, did you discover something about your father that you didn\u0092t know before?\nDonald Trump, Jr.: You know-- we-- we know him pretty well. And we\u0092ve got to, you know, be by his side for many years, both as a father and in business. So, you know-- the tenacity that he\u0092s always shown-- was just there. But it was just so much more. When I was watching him working 20-hour days, doing seven major speeches to tens of thousands of people and just saying, \u0093Well, it wasn\u0092t triage. Which state are we gonna do today,\u0094 it\u0092s, \u0093We\u0092re just gonna do \u0091em all. We\u0092re gonna speak to all of these people.\u0094 And I think people saw that energy. They fed off that energy. That energy was so much of the movement-- that he was able to create. And, you know-- it-- it only furthered what I already knew.\nLesley Stahl: I want to ask you all about something that\u0092s going on right now around the country. A lot of people are afraid. They\u0092re really afraid. African Americans think there\u0092s a target on their back. Muslims are terrified.\nDonald Trump: I think it\u0092s horrible if that\u0092s happening. I think it\u0092s built up by the press because, frankly, they\u0092ll take every single little incident that they can find in this country, which could\u0092ve been there before. If I weren\u0092t even around doing this, and they\u0092ll make into an event because that\u0092s the way the press is.\nLesley Stahl: Do any of you want to say anything about this fear that\u0092s out there?\nDonald Trump, Jr.: I-- I think the fears, you know, while they may be there, some fabricated, some not-- are totally unfounded.\nLesley Stahl: One of the groups that\u0092s expressing fear are the LGBTQ group. You--\nDonald Trump: And yet I mentioned them at the Republican National Convention. And--\nLesley Stahl: You did.\nDonald Trump: Everybody said, \u0093That was so great.\u0094 I have been, you know, I\u0092ve been-a supporter.\nLesley Stahl: Well, I guess the issue for them is marriage equality. Do you support marriage equality?\nDonald Trump: It-- it\u0092s irrelevant because it was already settled. It\u0092s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean it\u0092s done.\nLesley Stahl: So even if you appoint a judge that--\nDonald Trump: It\u0092s done. It-- you have-- these cases have gone to the Supreme Court. They\u0092ve been settled. And, I\u0092m fine with that.\nLesley Stahl: One of the issues that has come up in the campaign is your father\u0092s temperament. And he has himself has said, \u0093If someone insults me or says something unkind about me, I\u0092m gonna strike back.\u0094 And now people are saying, \u0093Well, maybe he should kinda soften that, control that a little.\u0094 What-- how do you think he\u0092s going to comport himself as president?\nEric Trump: I think very presidential. At the same time, my father, if he needs to be a fighter, he can be a fighter. And I think this country, quite frankly, needs a fighter. And I think that\u0092s what this country elected.\nDonald Trump: They spent $1 billion against me on the word \u0093Temperament.\u0094 It was given by Madison Avenue. And they thought that, by temperament, they could maybe, you know, win the election. Obviously, it didn\u0092t work because we\u0092re here and they\u0092re not. And I think my strongest asset is my temperament because I have a temperament where we win and we\u0092re going to start winning again. We\u0092re going to win on trade, we\u0092re going to win at the borders, we\u0092re going to knock out ISIS.\nLesley Stahl: You have said that you\u0092re gonna destroy ISIS. Now, how are you going to?\nDonald Trump: I don\u0092t tell you that. I don\u0092t tell you that.\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, but what can --\nDonald Trump: I\u0092m not like the people going in right now and fighting Mosul and they announced it four months before they went into Mosul and everybody now is -- it\u0092s a tough fight because, number one, the people from the --leaders of ISIS have left. What do you-- why do I have to tell you that?\nLesley Stahl: Troops on the ground?\nDonald Trump: I\u0092m not gonna say anything. I don\u0092t want to tell them anything. I don\u0092t want to tell anybody anything.\nLesley Stahl: Yeah, but what about\u0097the American people.\nDonald Trump: I wanna do the job. We have some great generals. We have great generals.\nLesley Stahl: You said you knew more than the generals about ISIS\nDonald Trump: Well, I\u0092ll be honest with you, I probably do because look at the job they\u0092ve done. OK, look at the job they\u0092ve done. They haven\u0092t done the job. Now, maybe it\u0092s leadership, maybe it\u0092s something else. Who knows? All I can tell you is we\u0092re going to get rid of ISIS.\nLesley Stahl: Let me ask you about Obamacare, which you say you\u0092re going to repeal and replace. When you replace it, are you going to make sure that people with pre-conditions are still covered?\nDonald Trump: Yes. Because it happens to be one of the strongest assets.\nLesley Stahl: You\u0092re going to keep that?\nDonald Trump: Also, with the children living with their parents for an extended period, we\u0092re gonna--\nLesley Stahl: You\u0092re gonna keep that--\nDonald Trump: Very much try and keep that. Adds cost, but it\u0092s very much something we\u0092re going to try and keep.\nLesley Stahl: And there\u0092s going to be a period if you repeal it and before you replace it, when millions of people could lose -\u0096 no?\nDonald Trump: No, we\u0092re going to do it simultaneously. It\u0092ll be just fine. We\u0092re not going to have, like, a two-day period and we\u0092re not going to have a two-year period where there\u0092s nothing. It will be repealed and replaced. And we\u0092ll know. And it\u0092ll be great health care for much less money. So it\u0092ll be better health care, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination.\nLesley Stahl: Roles during the administration. Any of you want a job in your father\u0092s administration? Eric Trump: So we have an amazing company. You know, one of, I think, the fortunate things for my father and our father is that he was able to step out of the company to run for commander-in-chief. And I think he\u0092s going to rely on us more than ever. And--\nLesley Stahl: So you\u0092ll stay up here?\nEric Trump: So we\u0092ll-- we\u0092ll-- we\u0092ll be in New York and we\u0092ll take care of the business. I think we\u0092re going to have a lot of fun doing it. And we\u0092re going to make him very proud.\nLesley Stahl: People think that you\u0092re going to be part of the administration, Ivanka.\nIvanka Trump: I\u0092m-- no. I\u0092m going to be a daughter. But I\u0092ve-- I\u0092ve said throughout the campaign that I am very passionate about certain issues. And that I want to fight for them.\nLesley Stahl: But you won\u0092t be inside--\nIvanka Trump: Wage equality, childcare. These are things that are very important for me. I\u0092m very passionate about education. Really promoting more opportunities for women. So you know, there\u0092re a lot of things that I feel deeply, strongly about. But not in a formal administrative capacity.\nLesley Stahl: Let me ask whether any of you think that the campaign has hurt the Trump brand.\nIvanka Trump: I don\u0092t think it matters. This is so much more important. And more serious. And-- so th-- I-- I-- you know, that\u0092s the focus.\nDonald Trump: I think what Ivanka trying to say, \u0093Who cares? Who cares?\u0094 This is big league stuff. This is-- this is our country. Our country is going bad. We\u0092re going to save our country. I don\u0092t care about hotel occupancy. It\u0092s peanuts compared to what we\u0092re doing. Health care, making people better. It\u0092s unfair what\u0092s happened to the people of our country and we\u0092re going to change it.

Loading ...", "285": "Print \nI feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy. For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women\u2019s rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system. \u201d \n\u2013 Hillary Clinton \nThe first salvo from Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton (or rather, her answer to the first question posed by Fox News\u2019 Chris Wallace to her and Donald Trump at the third presidential debate) was as chilling as it was an exemplar of hypocrisy. \nThose on the left are quite fond of leveling the accusation against conservatives of employing \u201cdog whistle politics,\u201d rhetoric that allegedly contains hidden or esoteric derogatory messaging which targets a specific subgroup within the opposition. Ms. Clinton\u2019s response to Wallace\u2019s question (where they wanted to see the Supreme Court take the country, and their views on how the Constitution ought to be interpreted) however, was representative of this tactic. \nWhile women\u2019s rights and those of the LGBT community may seem to be a curious focus for the high court (since objectively, women wouldn\u2019t appear to be particularly oppressed given that one has been nominated to run for president, and the LGBT community accounts for less than 5 percent of the American population), Clinton\u2019s answer revealed the focus she believes the court should have once she becomes empress. \n\u201cWomen\u2019s rights\u201d is of course \u201cdog whistle\u201d for unfettered abortion, even late-term abortion, which is essentially infanticide via dismemberment. \u201cLGBT rights\u201d is \u201cdog whistle\u201d for disenfranchising the majority of Americans who hold traditional values, primarily Christians. Leveraging a vocal minority of homosexuals, bisexuals and transgender individuals whom the left has whipped into a froth against Christians is the methodology that was employed to negate the political power of Christians in Europe and Canada. A direct assault via legislation in this area would not work in the U.S. (at least not at present); however, judicial rulings could effectively bring about the same result. \nLet us leave aside for a moment the fact that judicial activism is unethical and skirts the Constitution and that Clinton\u2019s overall objectives are manifestly evil. Hillary Clinton\u2019s stated priorities for the Supreme Court are a clear indicator of her desire to use the court as a bludgeon against the Constitution and individual liberties, rather than allowing it to perform its designated function. The hypocrisy attendant to Clinton citing the rights of women and homosexuals when she is beholden via financial contributions to nations that institutionally persecute and murder members of these groups remains plain for all to see, despite being conveniently ignored by the press. \nClinton\u2019s reference to \u201cpowerful corporations and the wealthy\u201d and the malign influence of that sinister conservative organization, Citizens United, was of course another exercise in blatant hypocrisy. Clinton is quite wealthy, and corrupt or otherwise compromised powerful corporations have been instrumental in bringing about the designs of American socialists. Even if Citizens United were a vehicle for \u201cdark, unaccountable money,\u201d the scope of its influence would pale next to the subversive designs of the Muslim Brotherhood , with which Bill and Hillary Clinton have been partnered for decades, or the myriad tentacles of organizations funded by George Soros , the former Nazi collaborator dedicated to advancing oligarchical collectivism in America, someone with whom the Clintons also have a long association. \nOne need not attempt to decipher the thinly veiled intent behind Clinton\u2019s debate rhetoric to discern what a Hillary Clinton presidency might look like. Her actions to date \u2013 and particularly those in the pursuit of seeking that office \u2013 should suffice quite nicely. Despite the craven complicity of the establishment press (mainstream media), there is ample evidence for even the most indolent news consumer to reach the conclusion that she and the Democratic leviathan supporting her, and which facilitated Barack Obama\u2019s rise to power, are fundamentally malignant. \nIn recent days, we\u2019ve become aware of all manner of unethical conspiracies and outright criminality that\u2019s been brought to bear in getting Clinton elected, from Democratic officials tampering with the outcome of the illegal email server investigation, to the oversampling of key demographics in polling in order to enhance the public perception of Clinton\u2019s popularity, to the recent revelation of criminally prosecutable actions on the part of the Clinton campaign, the Democratic National Committee and the White House. \nThe bottom line here is that Hillary Clinton represents a class of people who transcend even the loathed archetypal modern politician in their rapaciousness and amorality. What all Americans \u2013 not just voters, and not just Republicans \u2013 need to realize is that leaders at the highest levels in the Republican Party are every bit as culpable as the gutter operatives of the Democratic Party who pay miscreants to dress up as ducks, instigate fistfights at opposition rallies and, yes, even vote for their candidates. \nThe burning question is this: In the end, are we to be governed by the will of the people, or are we going to continue pretending that we have a representative government, when we are in effect being ruled by abject thugs operating behind a faux veneer of government?", "286": "From an Indiana pizzeria to a Washington State florist, America is grappling with a clash between gay rights and religious liberty. But there are paths forward.\n\nWhy climate scientists are taking fact-checking into their own hands\n\nArkansas state Rep. Warwick Sabin (D) cheers with others protesting the state's religious freedom law at the state Capitol in Little Rock last month.\n\nThe recent backlash against \u201creligious accommodation\u201d laws in Indiana and Arkansas is evidence of an increasingly bitter confrontation that is dividing the country and threatens to diminish the scope of religious liberty in America.\n\nThat is the conclusion of a number of scholars and experts who are urging the United States Supreme Court to consider this confrontation when it hears oral argument on April 28 in a potential landmark case involving same-sex marriage.\n\nOn one side are gay couples who are seeking the full benefits of equal treatment and dignity in a society that has long forced them into second-class status, or substantially worse.\n\nOn the other side are religious conservatives, who say they are being coerced to support and/or participate in activities that offend their religious beliefs.\n\nGay rights activists, sensing an approaching victory at the Supreme Court, are growing more aggressive in challenging the conservatives. Many argue that any accommodation of religious beliefs in the context of gay rights would amount to a \u201clicense to discriminate.\u201d\n\nConservatives counter that the issue is freedom of conscience. Religious accommodations traditionally have been provided to avoid the prospect of coercion against one\u2019s faith, they say.\n\nIndiana and Arkansas were just the latest flashpoints in what could become a major turning point. For the first time in US history, a sizeable social and political force seems intent on sharply restraining or eliminating religious accommodations, according to scholars who study religious freedom.\n\nNow with the Supreme Court poised to take up same-sex marriage, some advocates are hoping the high court will offer much-needed guidance to a nation torn between conflicting values.\n\nSome states, like Indiana, have tried to address the religious accommodation side of the equation, while others, like Utah, have taken a more comprehensive approach \u2013 addressing religion accommodations and antidiscrimination laws together.\n\nThe stakes involve more than just whether same-sex couples will be able to obtain a cake, or photographs, or flowers for their wedding. Ultimately at stake is a quintessential requirement of life in America: tolerance \u2013 on each side for the other.\n\nDouglas Laycock, a leading scholar of religious liberty, has staked out a middle ground position in the looming confrontation between gay rights and religious rights. He calls his approach \u201cliberty and justice for all.\u201d\n\n\u201cSame-sex civil marriage is a great advance for human liberty. But failure to attend to the religious-liberty implications will create a whole new set of problems for the liberties of those religious organizations and believers who cannot conscientiously recognize or facilitate such marriages,\u201d writes Mr. Laycock, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, in a friend-of-the-court brief.\n\nHe is urging the high court to recognize a constitutional right to same-sex marriage. And he believes states should pass laws barring discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nBut he also favors robust religious freedom restoration laws at the state level, and he is urging the justices to make clear in their opinion that religious conservatives retain broad freedom to live their lives in accord with their highest sense of morality and faith.\n\n\u201cThe gain for human liberty will be greatly undermined if same-sex couples now force religious dissenters to violate conscience in the same way that those dissenters, when they had the power to do so, forced same-sex couples to hide in the closet,\u201d Laycock said.\n\n\u201cThat is what will happen, unless this Court clearly directs the lower courts to protect religious liberty as well as same-sex civil marriage,\u201d he told the justices.\n\nIn a speech last fall, Sen. Orrin Hatch (R) of Utah warned that religious liberty was under attack \u2013 and losing ground. \u201cWhat was once a broad consensus here in the United States that religious freedom deserves special protection has recently crumbled,\u201d he said.\n\nThe senator said that gay rights organizations and other advocacy groups were increasingly opposed to religious exemptions that a few years ago would have passed without dissent.\n\n\u201cFrom my perspective, it appears that now these groups believe they are \u2018winning\u2019 the argument and therefore have no need for religious accommodations,\u201d he said. \u201cWhereas in the past they were willing to respect religious freedom, now that they believe they have the upper hand they are ready to disregard religious liberty altogether.\u201d\n\nLast June, the Supreme Court pushed back against this trend in a 5-to-4 decision upholding a religious accommodation for the owners of Hobby Lobby.\n\nWithin weeks of that ruling, 56 senators voted to overturn the decision and eliminate the accommodation. The tally, only four votes short of the 60 needed to advance the bill, included every Senate Democrat and three Republicans.\n\nThe uproar sparked by Indiana\u2019s passage of its own Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) in late March illustrates the potential high stakes for religious conservatives.\n\nIndiana lawmakers and Republican Gov. Mike Pence encountered a swift and unrelenting backlash by a well-organized gay rights campaign supported by major business leaders, Democratic governors, and others threatening to unleash an economic boycott against an entire state.\n\nThose threats prompted Republican leaders in Indiana and Arkansas to quickly retreat and water down their religious freedom laws.\n\nIt also directed a national spotlight on the intersection of gay rights and religious rights.\n\nIt did so in part by focusing on an eight-table pizza shop in Walkerton, Ind.\n\nMemories Pizza owner Kevin O\u2019Connor and his daughter, Crystal, said they would serve any gay or lesbian customers in the shop. But they added that they would refuse to cater a same-sex wedding because such a ceremony would offend their religious beliefs about marriage.\n\nThe store closed for eight days after receiving threats and hate mail. At the same time, supporters on a fundraising website contributed more than $840,000 to the shop.\n\nThe action against Memories Pizza erupted not from an actual request for service from a gay couple. It resulted from a hypothetical question from a local television news reporter.\n\nOther well-known cases involve a Colorado bakery\u2019s refusal to bake a wedding cake for a same-sex marriage ceremony, a New Mexico photographer\u2019s refusal to photograph a same-sex commitment ceremony, and a Washington florist\u2019s decision not to design floral arrangements for a same-sex wedding.\n\nIn each case, the Christian business owner said the refusal was based on a sincerely-held religious belief about the sanctity of marriage. And in each case, the courts ruled that the Christian owners violated laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\n\u201cIn the last year or so, with the rise of the push for gay rights, it is beyond wanting there to be an appreciation and respect for gay rights. Now a segment of our population is seeking to have that right trump religious freedom,\u201d said Jeffrey Mateer, a lawyer with Liberty Institute in Plano, Texas.\n\n\u201cWe are seeing people of faith being attacked, discriminated against, and losing their jobs because they are speaking out on the marriage issue,\u201d Mr. Mateer said.\n\nAmong other cases cited by conservatives:\n\nIt isn\u2019t just a matter of filing lawsuits or challenging the award of government benefits to certain businesses. The broader campaign often portrays religious conservatives as bigots. The strategy appears aimed at discrediting any claim to the American tradition of solicitude to religious adherents involving sincere matters of faith.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s one way of looking at it,\u201d says Yale Law School Professor William Eskridge. \u201cHere\u2019s another way. What counts as a religious reason is highly dynamic.\u201d\n\nIn the 1960s, opponents of the Civil Rights Act used the Bible to try to justify continued discrimination against African-Americans, notes Professor Eskridge, a leading scholar of gay rights. It didn\u2019t work. The tactic was swept aside as the tide of public opinion embraced the principle of equality for African-Americans.\n\nEskridge suggests it is only a matter of time before gay rights become normalized across the country, and religious and moral arguments are swept aside and discarded.\n\n\u201cOne of the lessons of history unfortunately is that very often the line between bigotry and religious doctrine or religious faith is not a clear-cut line, particularly when public opinion is swiftly changing,\u201d Eskridge said.\n\nThe professor predicted that as the nation\u2019s rapid embrace of gay rights continues, public norms and the law will also change. So will religious practice and belief, he said.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve already seen it. And we are going to continue to see it,\u201d he said. \u201cSome religions are literally changing their doctrine.\u201d\n\nSo where does that leave the state of interplay between gay rights activists and religious conservatives?\n\nThe legal landscape is a patchwork. Even if the US Supreme Court rules in late June that all 50 states must issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples, only 22 states currently have laws prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation.\n\nThat means that gay men and lesbians are vulnerable to discrimination in 28 states.\n\nAmong those 28 states: Indiana and Arkansas.\n\nSome observers view the recent ugly flare-up in the culture war in both states as a missed opportunity.\n\nHad officials in Indiana and Arkansas sought to pass their new religious freedom restoration laws in concert with new legal protections for the lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) community, the energy invested in threatened boycotts and waging heated protests would have been expended instead on celebrations of leadership and progress, these analysts say.\n\nRobin Fretwell Wilson knows how to get this done. She was an adviser to the effort do it in one of the most conservative states in America.\n\n\u201cAt a time of great change, people have to know what the rules are,\u201d says Ms. Fretwell, a professor at the University of Illinois College of Law. The idea is to get the relevant parties around a table and negotiate a set of rules acceptable to all.\n\nIt employs a common sense approach: If you are sensitive to our concerns, we\u2019ll be sensitive to yours.\n\nThe result was the Utah Compromise. It passed the Republican-controlled state legislature and was signed into law last month with the blessing of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.\n\nWhen it takes effect on May 11, it will mark the first time in state history that gay men, lesbians, bisexuals, and transgender people have specific legal protections prohibiting discrimination in housing and employment because of sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n\u201cUtah gets it right on every single score,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cThey did something good and decent for the LGBT community, but they did not make it come at the expense of religious believers. I think that\u2019s huge.\u201d\n\nThe workplace protections apply to all businesses with 15 or more workers, including state agencies, local governments, and school districts. It does not apply to religious organizations, religious schools, and wholly-owned subsidiaries of religious organizations. It also exempts the Boy Scouts.\n\nThe compromise has its critics. Some say it does not go far enough.\n\nFor example, the Utah Compromise does not address the thorny issue of public accommodations \u2013 whether a small business such as a bakery, wedding planner, or florist must participate in same-sex wedding ceremonies if they have religious objections.\n\nBut within the compromise are the seeds of a solution to that problem, as well, Wilson says.\n\nThe agreement establishes a right for any qualified person in Utah to get married at a county clerk\u2019s office. But under the agreement, no official in any clerk\u2019s office can be fired or otherwise forced to officiate a same-sex wedding if they have a religious objection.\n\nInstead, every clerk\u2019s office in Utah \u2013 including in rural counties \u2013 must have a process that provides a willing celebrant to any same-sex couple seeking to marry at the clerk\u2019s office.\n\nThere is a term for this kind of approach. It is called religious accommodation.\n\nWilson says she is developing a similar model that may offer a compromise for religious business owners who are worried about getting sued over their religious objections to participating in a same-sex wedding.\n\nIn the medical field, there are recognized abortion conscience clauses that exempt certain medical professionals from involvement in that procedure because of their religious beliefs. In effect, someone else takes their place through a prearranged process.\n\n\u201cWhen that happens, no one says you are being mean to the lady who wants an abortion,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cWe don\u2019t even think about it that way.\u201d\n\nThe same prearranged process could be set up at a Christian-owned bakery or flower shop. In essence, those parts of the business serving same-sex marriages would be handled by workers (in-house or by contract) who do not have a religious objection to such ceremonies.\n\n\u201cThe idea that you show up in the moment and get refused by a religious person is really, really hard to choke down. I don\u2019t think the gay rights people are going to be able to bargain to that,\u201d Wilson says. \u201cAnd the idea that you suddenly let gay rights run roughshod over every religious person in the community is also hard to choke down.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cSo if we can find a model where everybody gets served and religious people don\u2019t have to leave those jobs, I think we\u2019d do a really good thing.\u201d\n\nWilson\u2019s approach holds great promise, particularly in conservative red states looking for solutions or to avoid economic boycotts. But not everyone is ready and willing to negotiate a cease-fire in the culture war.\n\nThat\u2019s where the concept of a RFRA may become essential as an increasing number of cases move into the courts.\n\nMuch of the controversy last month in Indiana and Arkansas was premised on misinformation and misconceptions on both sides of the debate, according to legal experts.\n\nSome conservatives were under the false impression that a RFRA would offer guaranteed protection against lawsuits by same-sex couples. And some gay rights activists argued, incorrectly, that the Indiana RFRA would be a \u201clicense to discriminate.\u201d\n\nUncritical press reports parroted this line, over and over.\n\nThe debate kicked up gobs of dust and fury, but shed almost no light on the real purpose of passing a state RFRA, analysts say.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it is right to view RFRAs in light of gay rights specifically, because RFRA has always protected religious minority groups,\u201d says Eric Rassbach, a lawyer at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty in Washington.\n\nHe says RFRAs have helped protect a Santeria priest seeking an exemption from a local ordinance outlawing goat sacrifices; it is being invoked to help native Americans who need an exemption from federal law to possess eagle feathers. The law has been used to uphold the right of a Sikh accountant to pass through security at a federal building in possession of her religious \u201ckirpan,\u201d a small dull dagger that is as symbolic to Sikhs as the cross is to Christians.\n\nIn January, the US Supreme Court applied a RFRA-like statute and ruled that the Arkansas prison system must allow a Muslim inmate to grow a short beard in compliance with his religious faith. That ruling was 9 to 0.\n\n\u201cIf people want to go around stopping RFRAs or neutering RFRAs, the people who are going to be hurt will be the religious minorities \u2013 the Sikhs, the native Americans, the Muslims, the Orthodox Jews,\u201d Mr. Rassbach said.\n\n\u201cI think that is a real problem for our society because we are not getting less religiously diverse, we are becoming more heterogeneous,\u201d he said.\n\nThe purpose of passing a religious freedom restoration law is not to grant a right to engage in anti-gay discrimination, Rassbach and other analysts say. The law isn\u2019t designed to work that way, and it hasn\u2019t worked that way in practice.\n\nNo religious exemption sought under RFRA has ever been granted in any case involving alleged sexual orientation discrimination.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean there won\u2019t be an accommodation granted in the future. But these results suggest RFRA is no \u201clicense to discriminate.\u201d\n\nThe real license to discriminate in Indiana was the state\u2019s lack of a statute prohibiting discrimination because of sexual orientation. That is a license to discriminate, legal experts say.\n\nIn contrast, the purpose of a RFRA is different. The law is designed to allow a neutral judge to weigh the competing interests when a law that is applied broadly imposes a significant burden on sincerely-held religious beliefs.\n\nWhen that happens, there must be proof that the provision advances a compelling government interest and that it is tailored to do that in a way least restrictive of religious faith.\n\nThis approach was not dreamed up in some backroom legislative chamber in Indiana. It is a legal standard that was recognized as a constitutional guarantee for the entire country and was enforced by the US Supreme Court from 1963 to 1990.\n\nDespite this broad, constitutional protection of religious conscience, religious adherents didn\u2019t always prevail. In 1983, Bob Jones University argued for a religious exemption from a federal regulation prohibiting tax-exempt organizations from discriminating on the basis of race. The university had a rule barring interracial dating.\n\nThe high court held that the government had a fundamental \u2013 and overriding \u2013 interest in ending any vestige of racial discrimination in education.\n\nThough the decision did not diminish the importance of religious accommodations in general, it put religious adherents on notice: fighting discrimination is a compelling government interest that can outweigh a claim for religious accommodation.\n\nThen, in 1990, the high court abruptly changed course. The justices were presented with a case involving two drug counselors who were fired for their sacramental use of peyote as members of the Native American Church. They were also denied unemployment benefits. The two sued the state of Oregon, seeking a religious accommodation that would allow them to collect the benefits.\n\nA divided Supreme Court ruled that the free exercise clause of the Constitution did not authorize a religious exemption from laws of general applicability.\n\nThis was a major constitutional shift that made it more difficult for religious adherents \u2013 particularly those in minority religions \u2013 to seek accommodations from general laws that imposed significant burdens on their faith.\n\nCongress responded in 1993 by passing the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. (It passed the House by voice vote, and the Senate 97 to 3.) The statute reestablished the same national legal standard of religious accommodation that had been enforced by the high court from 1963 to 1990.\n\nThen in 1997, the Supreme Court ruled that the federal RFRA only applied to federal law, not at the state or local level.\n\nIn response to that decision, states began enacting their own religious freedom restoration acts. Currently, 22 states \u2013 including Indiana and Arkansas \u2013 have enacted RFRAs.\n\nIn addition, 11 other states have interpreted their state constitutions as providing guarantees of religious liberty consistent with the standard enforced by the US Supreme Court from 1963 to 1990.\n\nThus, 33 of the 50 states have in some fashion embraced the broad concept of offering religious accommodations.\n\nHow the approaching legal battles will play out is uncertain.\n\nSome cases will be preempted by automatic exemptions from discrimination laws that have long been granted to religious organizations and affiliated groups.\n\nBut the stage is now set for litigation over public accommodations related to same-sex marriages. Ironically, most of those cases will be litigated not in conservative \u201cred\u201d states, but in liberal \u201cblue\u201d states that have already accepted gay marriage. That\u2019s because there are no antidiscrimination statutes in most red states that would allow a same-sex couple to file a lawsuit.\n\n\u201cIt is that middle area of the small business, individual proprietorship, the mom and pop enterprise; that\u2019s the area where this is going to bite,\u201d Eskridge says. \u201cThat is in play and it is highly dynamic.\u201d\n\nThe professor sees the legal landscape shifting against accommodation claims. \u00a0\u201cAccommodations that would have been given in courts 10 years ago are not going to be given in courts 10 years from now, or even today in some cases.\u201d\n\nIn courts across the country the critical question is going to be whether it is possible to strike a balance between discrimination and religious accommodation.\n\nWhat is at stake is more fundamental than cakes, and photographs, and flowers. It is whether at some point politicians and judges begin to look for ways to defuse disputes so that both sides can start moving forward together toward tolerance and acceptance.\n\nThe alternative is more Indiana-style protests and boycotts.\n\n\u201cWhat was so devastating for the religious community was to be seen as saying we have to have our religious freedom so that we can knock down your gay rights. When they say stuff like that \u2013 which is just ugly \u2013 they lose,\u201d Wilson says.\n\n\u201cBut on the other side, if the gay rights guys say I have to run you out of business in order for me to win, that is just as ugly, and they will lose,\u201d she says.", "287": "Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) came to a convention of libertarian-leaning Republicans and talked about shrinking government, slashing regulations, fighting against the bulk collection of phone data and his great affinity for a rival in the presidential race.\n\nPaul, Kentucky\u2019s junior U.S. senator and scion of one of the country\u2019s most famous libertarian families, was expected to lock down the support of libertarian voters in the presidential campaign. But as Paul\u2019s poll numbers have sagged nationally \u2014 and in such libertarian-minded places as New Hampshire \u2014 Cruz is trying to pick off what is sometimes called the liberty vote.\n\nCruz essentially crashed what was supposed to be Paul\u2019s big libertarian party here, the biennial meeting of the Republican Liberty Caucus. Cruz stood in a hotel here on a dreary Friday morning, surrounded by supporters and curious attendees who held signs and jostled for photos.\n\n\u201cI was elected with tremendous support from the liberty movement,\u201d Cruz said of his 2012 Senate campaign, noting that Rand Paul and his father, former representative Ron Paul (R-Tex.), both endorsed him in that race.\n\nThe Texas Republican\u2019s presidential campaign has been making the case that as Paul\u2019s campaign has floundered, Cruz is viable \u2014 flush with cash and able to go the distance.\n\nOn the trail, Cruz has invoked the Fourth Amendment\u2019s privacy protections and railed against the Federal Reserve. Last month, the campaign rolled out a video showing eight supporters of Ron Paul\u2019s 2012 presidential campaign who are backing Cruz for 2016.\n\n\u201cThe liberty movement has been integral to our campaign since Day One,\u201d Cruz said.\n\nCruz breaks down the Republican electorate into four brackets of support: tea party conservatives; evangelical Christians; establishment Republicans; and libertarians. He sees his base in the tea party and evangelical wings, but he also is trying to siphon off libertarian voters with a message of limited government.\n\nCruz tailored his speech here in New Hampshire to those voters. He took a less hawkish tone when discussing foreign policy, saying that the United States \u201cshouldn\u2019t engage in nation-building\u201d and calling for armed Kurdish ground troops to fight the Islamic State.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no reason for us to get in the middle of the Syrian civil war,\u201d he said.\n\nCruz praised the liberty movement as an \u201camazing thing\u201d and vowed that the size of government will be \u201cmaterially smaller\u201d if he is elected president. He promoted a bill he co-sponsored to end the bulk collection of phone metadata \u2014 an issue that Rand Paul championed this year with a nearly 11-hour Senate floor speech.\n\n\u201cThis is the battleground between Cruz and Paul,\u201d said Dave Nalle, a former chairman of the Liberty Caucus. He said Paul appeals to privacy-minded libertarians while Cruz appeals to those who want a strict adherence to the Constitution.\n\n\u201cI was impressed\u201d with Cruz, said Louis Colavecchio Sr. of Wakefield, R.I., who also said he has not decided whom he will support in the primary.\n\nThe scramble for supporters seems to have somewhat strained the cordial relationship between the onetime Senate allies. Last month, Paul said Cruz was \u201cpretty much done for\u201d in the Senate after Cruz tried to disrupt the passage of a government funding bill because it would give money to Planned Parenthood.\n\n\u201cTed has chosen to make this really personal and chosen to call people dishonest in leadership .\u2009.\u2009. which really goes against the decorum and also against the rules of the Senate, and as a consequence he can\u2019t get anything done legislatively,\u201d Paul said on Fox News Radio. On Friday, Cruz called Paul \u201ca friend\u201d and \u201cgood man.\u201d\n\nPaul gave an animated speech here and appeared to be in his comfort zone, saying he wants a government that leaves him alone. He reminded his audience of his marathon Senate speech to defend that principle. He called for reform of the criminal-justice system, and he knocked other candidates for saying they would not hold talks with rival nations. Paul also rapped Congress, labeling a just-passed bill that temporarily funds the government \u201ca bunch of crap\u201d and the body itself \u201cimpotent and inconsequential.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m embarrassed that I\u2019m even a part of it,\u201d said Paul, sporting a bright-blue belt with the University of Kentucky\u2019s logo on it.\n\nPaul played down the threat from Cruz.\n\n\u201cBoth here and Iowa, we know where our support is and where my dad\u2019s support was, and we feel comfortable that the overwhelming majority of it is with us,\u201d Paul said.\n\nSome libertarians here were uncomfortable with Cruz making religion such a large part of his campaign.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to have as much sway on Rand Paul\u2019s electability as people think he will, because he\u2019s a religious zealot. It\u2019s too much,\u201d said Austin Sekel, 22, who is supporting Paul. Cruz \u201cneeds to stop grandstanding on the Senate floor,\u201d he said.\n\nSekel and others said they do not think Paul\u2019s sagging poll numbers will change anything. Sekel thinks Paul has a base of support that has not yet become engaged in the campaign.\n\nBob Pyle, a pastor from Harrisburg, Pa., said Paul has a \u201csolid, loyal following that is not given to the sounds of throwing red meat.\u201d Between those people and Ron Paul supporters, Pyle said the Kentucky Republican\u2019s fortunes will only increase.\n\nOther people here are not completely enamored of either candidate. Some libertarians have said that Paul has run his race too far from his father\u2019s pure libertarian principles. They include John Cisar, 36, of Burlington, Vt.\n\n\u201cI think there\u2019s a big schism among libertarians that he\u2019s fallen short of expectations,\u201d Cisar said of Paul. Cisar said that he is not a Cruz fan and that he thinks Paul is the more acceptable of the two in the 2016 race.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s the lesser of the evils,\u201d Cisar said of Paul. \u201cAnd that doesn\u2019t make me feel really good inside to vote for him.\u201d", "288": "In a Tuesday editorial, the paper\u2019s opinion editors cast significant doubt on the Texas Republican\u2019s ability to assemble a winning coalition, arguing that Cruz\u2019s assumption that he can win by turning out more white conservative voters is fundamentally flawed and warning that the Tea Party firebrand\u2019s hardline stance on immigration makes him \u201ca dream come true for Hillary Clinton,\u201d the likely Democratic nominee in 2016.\n\nBlaming Cruz for \u201cplunging\u201d the GOP\u2019s favorability by leading the 2013 government shutdown \u2014 part of a botched attempt to derail health care reform \u2014 the Journal depicts Cruz as a polarizing figure all too willing to reflexively oppose anything the Obama administration proposes. The editors castigate Cruz as an \u201copportunist\u201d for seeking to pare back government surveillance and for opposing the administration\u2019s abortive effort to authorize air strikes in Syria in 2013 \u2014 stances that Cruz took despite a generally hawkish worldview.\n\nAs for Cruz\u2019s claim that Republicans like 2012 nominee Mitt Romney have lost because they failed to galvanize the right-wing base, the Journal allows that \u201cRomney in particular failed to motivate enough conservatives.\u201d However, the editors posit, Cruz \u201cis probably wrong to think that conservatives alone, especially white conservatives, can elect the next President,\u201d adding that the party\u2019s 2016 nominee \u201cmust broaden the GOP\u2019s electoral appeal.\u201d Part of that, the editorial suggests, entails a softer line on immigration; continued opposition to reform will only prove a boon to Democratic efforts to keep Latino voters solidly in the blue column.\n\nThis being the Wall Street Journal editorial board, the piece is not without pot-shots at Democrats. Indeed, the editorial is framed around the notion that Cruz is the Republican version of Barack Obama. There are areas of overlap: Both began their presidential bids as 40-something first-term senators, both graduated from Harvard Law School, both are perceived as dynamic speakers, and both boast appeal among key segments of their parties\u2019 respective constituencies. Although the similarities largely end there, the Journal insists otherwise. Much as Cruz is notorious for his scorched-earth Tea Party tactics, the Journal would have us believe that Obama harbors \u201ccontempt\u201d for Republicans and for the very idea of \u201cwork[ing] across the aisle.\u201d\n\nIn the latter half of his second term, Obama may have come to the belated realization\u00a0that Republicans had no interest in cooperating with him, but the president reached this conclusion only after the failure of his assiduous efforts to woo GOP support. His 2008 campaign rested on the notion that he, not Hillary Clinton, would bridge Washington\u2019s partisan divide, and he spent much of his first term negotiating against himself in the vain hope that his proposals would garner Republican backing. There was the largely fruitless effort to secure GOP support for the 2009 stimulus package, for instance, and the months-long, ill-fated bid to get then-Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) to vote for health care reform. Obama\u2019s Kumbayaism was doomed literally from the start; just as Obama took office, top congressional Republicans decided in a closed-door meeting that the next four years would be ones of knee-jerk opposition to the president\u2019s policies. Six years later, Cruz is telling Republicans that the obstructionists who run his party aren\u2019t intransigent enough.

October 28, 2016 \nReprinted from IsraelNationalNews.com . \nCommendably, organized American Jewry is finally focused on the campaign to boycott, de-legitimize, and sanction Israel. However, focusing primarily on Israel, and not also on America and Europe, is short-sighted. \nThe BDS campaign has not devastated Israel economically. Israel is thriving both economically and in terms of regional alliances\u2014but fifty years of a well-funded propaganda campaign has all but destroyed Israel's good name and has rendered her and Jews everywhere vulnerable to diplomatic, academic, and mob attacks. \nIt has also lowered the standards for truth among Americans. This is a very important point. \nAn Islamic-style of Jew hatred has merged with Western, politically correct anti-racism to breed an unnatural passion for \"Palestinians,\" (Fakestinians), which has infiltrated every corner, every crevice of our lives and world. It has infected Americans and Europeans on both sides of the aisle and of every class, race, and ethnicity. \nThis is utterly astounding, amazing really; something like this does not happen overnight. \nThe BDS campaign is rooted in the Arab League, PLO, and Soviet propaganda campaign that began in the mid-1960s. In the mid-1970s, the UN proposed its infamous Zionism=Racism resolution. \nIn 1967, the day after Israel won yet another war of self-defense, Israel--not the Arab aggressors--was seen as the alleged \"occupier.\" \nBy the late 1970\u2019s, Edward Said's treacherous, lying work had begun to have its way with Western academics, (and with Western-style academics in Israel), European governments, and international organizations. \nI only realized how successful his campaign was in 1980, when Israel was demonized at a UN conference on Women in Copenhagen. The Soviets, the Iranians, the Arab League, the PLO-- roamed the hallways chanting \"Death to Israel;\" European feminists called upon \"Palestinian\" refugees but refused to hear Jewish-Israeli refugees from Arab and Muslim countries. By 2001, the UN World Conference Against Racism in Durban was an even more out-of-control Hate Fest and riot against Israel. \nAs we approach 2017, UN Resolutions against Israel are as commonplace as they are grotesque. UNESCO\u2019s recent decision to De-Judaize Jerusalem, the Western Wall, and the First and Second Temples is a grim and maddening continuation of this trend. At the same time, pro-Israel professors and students in America are increasingly being harassed, even fired. \nSuch Lies have infiltrated my private social world. For example: At a recent holiday dinner, our guests agreed that we live in criminal and anarchic times and that no great power has stopped global barbarism, no entity is willing to bring the world back from the brink. \nA like-minded gathering, yes? Not exactly. One man, a genial, well-heeled, well-educated Jewish-American suddenly began hectoring us about the \"Palestinians.\" \"What if they did not hate the Jews and destroyed all their textbooks that demonize Jews and Israelis? What if they were peaceful? Wouldn't we have to admit that Palestinians have always existed and therefore deserve a state of their own? You can't deny that the Palestinian people have always lived there, can you?\" Oh my. Where to start? The company included two author-scholars who, between them, have published 15 books and thousands of articles, many of them dealing with the history and nature of Islam, tribal gender and religious apartheid, Israel, and anti-Semitism, etc. Among us was a third author, who had also served four tours of duty in the IDF. I held my breath and prayed that we would not go to war at the table. This man was punching way above his pay grade and I could not understand why. \nThe two author-scholars presented facts, cited statistics. I pulled down book after book from my shelves. We got nowhere. \"Look,\" he said. \"I have some really good Muslim friends, they're Americans, totally Westernized, they are Palestinians. They strongly feel that this is their identity. Why deny them the identity of their choice?\" And then I understood that the pro-Palestinian/anti-Zionist propaganda behind the relentless BDS campaign is successful precisely because so many Americans of all ages, are without knowledge; without respect for knowledge; do not know this; and frankly, don't care. \n\"Fair is fair,\" he said. In other words: What's good for the Jews has to be good for everyone else. If not, the Jews don't deserve whatever it is either. \nHere's a man who's not an anti-Semite or an anti-Zionist; not an active member of any organization--yet who needs to believe the canard that non-Jewish \"Palestinians\" have always existed; or that they existed by the nineteenth century or no later than 1948, the year that another stateless people--the Jews--chose a national sovereign identity. \nHe would not listen to reason. It was quite astounding. How is this possible? \nHis mind-set is part of our ruling American zeitgeist. If Rachel Dolezal can say she's \"black\" even when she's \"white\" and direct a chapter of the NAACP; if a man can say that he's really a woman, trapped in a man's body; if all truth(s) are \"relative;\" if everything is \"subjective;\" if objectivity is no longer important; if doctored narratives have supplanted fact-based histories; if revisionism is preferred to truth--then, yes, anyone can say that they deserve their own nation state because they \"feel\" or \"believe\" that they do. \nI am grateful to my combative guest for reminding me that ignorance is often arrogant and as such, is a great enemy; that educated people have been especially vulnerable to False Ideas; that, psychologically speaking, we must approach them as if they've been brainwashed by a cult. \nFacts alone will not work. We must consider all known techniques for de-programming. \nThis is one of our greatest challenges.", "292": "Remember last fall, when pundits and politicians were trying to talk themselves into Paul Ryan as Speaker of the House because he would lay down the law with the hard-right wing of the Republican caucus? When he was the man who could bring some much-needed order to the ranks? Who could maybe end this habit of careening from crisis to crisis that Congress has fallen into because the two parties are unable to agree on anything, down to whether toilet paper should be rolled over or under in Capitol Hill bathrooms, let alone a budget to fund the basic functions of government?\n\nAs the kids like to say, LOL:\n\n\u201cThe release of President Obama\u2019s eighth and final budget on Tuesday has forced into the open the seething tensions that never really went away after a spending agreement was reached last year, in part to ease Mr. Ryan\u2019s transition into the speaker\u2019s suite. That deal set spending until the end of October of this year, at levels that the president adhered to and Senate Republicans hope to make stick. But a core group of House Republicans who gave Mr. Ryan a pass back then now say they want to toss those numbers out like so much flotsam and pass their own budget with far tighter spending restrictions.\u201d\n\nThat \u201ccore group of House Republicans\u201d is the House Freedom Caucus, the band of 40\u00a0or so feral meerkats who did much of the heavy lifting in driving John Boehner into retirement. But they aren\u2019t the only Republicans who look like infants here. Rep. Tom Price (R-GA) and Sen. Mike Enzi (R-WY), the chairs of the House and Senate Budget Committees, last week announced they will not even let the director of the Office of Management and Budget present the proposed budget to the Congress. This practice is a common courtesy extended to presidential administrations for the last 40\u00a0years or so.\n\nNo one would expect any Congress to rubber-stamp a president\u2019s budget proposal, of course. Not even if the same party controlled both chambers and the White House. But what\u2019s notable here is this quote from one member of the Freedom Caucus:\n\nRight, except you\u2019re not passing a Republican budget any more than President Obama expects you to pass a Democratic budget. The president\u2019s proposal is the opening to a negotiation, to be hashed out between two parties. Is anyone available who can explain the job of legislating to these legislators?\n\nBut like so many other legislative norms that the Republicans in Congress have tossed out the window during the Obama era, the practice of two co-equal branches of government openly and fairly debating genuine issues that will affect the American people has been given the heave-ho. Yet I\u2019d bet cash money some of these legislators like Mulvaney and Price are also just astonished that bullying idiot Donald Trump is stomping their party\u2019s candidates for the Republican nomination.\n\nPaul Ryan knows how this is supposed to work. He was, after all, the ranking Republican member of the House Budget Committee for the four years the Democrats controlled the House from 2007 to 2011. Then, when the GOP regained the majority in the chamber, he chaired the committee for another four years, until 2015. If anyone in the House knows how the budget sausage gets made, knows all the little compromises over appropriations levels and priorities that go into funding the government, it\u2019s Ryan. But as part of his deal to earn his Republican colleagues\u2019 votes for Speaker, Ryan devolved a fair amount of power for setting legislative agendas back to the committee chairmen. This took away one of the tools that past Speakers like Boehner could use as leverage to get bills they favored taken up by individual committees. With that gone, a weak Speaker is practically a helpless bystander to this sort of spectacle. Sure, maybe he can still yank the chairmanship away from Price, but that will just raise howls of protest from the other chairs who thought they had freedom to run things as they see fit. And though Price isn\u2019t a member of the Freedom Caucus, you can bet that group approves of what he\u2019s doing. If Ryan punishes him, he gets an even louder revolt on his right flank, in the middle of an election year. But beyond all this inside-baseball stuff is a point that many pundits have hammered on over and over during the primary campaign. Which is that this partisan infection of the House is not going away after the 2016 election, or even after 2018 and likely not until sometime after the next census in 2020, if it happens at all. So even if Democrats still hold the White House next year, either Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton will spend much of his or her time negotiating and fighting these budget fights just to keep the government\u2019s lights on, let alone pushing through major changes to healthcare or financial industry regulations. Plus, there\u2019s a good chance he or she will be saddled with Paul Ryan as Speaker, and he\u2019s about as solid as helium. By the end of 2017, we may all be longing for the halcyon days when John Boehner ran things.", "293": "Lifting weights could ward off dementia and make you smarter \n  by: Vicki Batts Tags: weight lifting , dementia , brain health (NaturalNews) There are many reasons to partake in strength training; weight-baring exercises are known for their health benefits. But, could lifting weights also boost your brain? Recent research indicates that may just be the case.To begin the study, researchers asked a group of people aged 55 to 86 to engage in a mix of weight lifting and brain training exercises. All of the people who partook in the study had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, which is a precursor to Alzheimer's disease , and is an early sign of dementia.While this particular study did not examine whether the benefits of exercise could be extended to the general population, the results were quite impressive. Published in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society , the study found that weight-baring exercises could indeed provide some brain benefits. The researchers found a casual relationship between an increase in muscle strength and an increase in brain function. On that basis, the team recommended that more people begin a strength training regime so that the world's aging population can hopefully be a little healthier. It is currently projected that about 135 million people will have dementia by the year 2050.The same team behind this most recent research also published a paper in 2014 that revealed that weight training provided cognitive benefits to just about every area of the brain \u2013 something cognitive training failed to do.While discussing their most recent data, one of the study's researchers, Dr. Yorgi Mavros of Sydney University, commented, \"What we found in this follow-up study is that the improvement in cognition function was related to their muscle strength gains. The stronger people became, the greater the benefit for their brain.\"For the strength training, study participants were asked to lift weights that were equivalent to about 80 percent of their maximum capacity, twice a week for six months \u2013 similar to the way in which many athletes train. And, as the participants got stronger, the amount of weight they lifted went up as well, in order to maintain the desired 80 percent of their maximum effort.Brain scans revealed that certain regions of the brain actually increased in size for those who took part in the exercise regime. Dr. Mavros says that the benefits were profound enough to warrant recommending weight training for everyone.\"The more we can get people doing resistance training like weight lifting , the more likely we are to have a healthier ageing population,\" he told the Independent . Dr. Mavros also added that the best way to ensure that you get the most benefit from exercise is by maintaining a regular routine. Exercising frequently, and with some intensity, is key to getting the most out of what you're doing.This new research is not the first to suggest that exercise can provide benefits to brain health . The body of research linking physical exercise to better cognitive function has only continued to grow over the last several years. Science has indicated that in addition to better mental health, exercise can also promote both better memory and concentration.Dr. James Pickett, head of research at the Alzheimer's Society, also had a few things to say about this new study. He noted, \"New research is beginning to unravel how physical exercise may have benefits for the brain as people get older. This study suggests that people with minor memory and thinking problems, known as mild cognitive impairment, may benefit from weight training to improve their brain health.\"Pickett also noted that while it is not yet clear if exercise can reverse dementia, they do know that it is one of the most important factors in its prevention. Along with being active, he says that not smoking and eating a healthy, balanced diet are all essential to reducing the risk.

After withdrawing the last U.S. troops in 2011, President Barack Obama declared the country \u201csovereign, stable and self-reliant.\u201d No such luck. Iraq plunged back into chaos as the Islamic State stormed the region last year, and the fall of Ramadi in May revived questions about how, and whether, the country can be salvaged.\n\nAs Americans try to understand what $2 trillion and nearly 4,500 American lives really accomplished, partisans are battling over how much blame falls on Obama, who left Iraq, and on President George W.

In June, Politico Magazine assembled a dozen experts\u2014including veterans of both administrations from the State Department, White House, Pentagon and the CIA\u2014and asked a simple question: Who lost Iraq? \u2014Michael Crowley\n\nMichael Crowley: Ambassador Khalilzad, you were in Iraq from 2005 to 2007. Describe the trajectory Iraq was on when you left, and the Iraq that Obama inherited when he was inaugurated in January 2009.\n\nZalmay Khalilzad: It was a very difficult period. Especially in the aftermath of the al-Askari Mosque bombing in 2006, the sectarian violence became front and center\u2014a very large number of fatalities and causalities, both Shia and Sunni\u2014and the rise of Al Qaeda in Iraq. We began a more concerted effort training Iraqi troops, which resulted in significant growth in their size and capabilities. The new Iraqi government led by Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki showed more willingness to use force against the Shia militias in Basra and Baghdad\u2019s Sadr City. Additionally, the excesses committed by Al Qaeda in Iraq against the Sunni community was beginning to turn some Sunnis against them. With increased outreach to the Sunnis, we began to have significant numbers of them work with us.\n\nThere were still some issues unresolved\u2014there was no oil law for the distribution of resources, there still was no reform of de-Baathification. These were self-inflicted wounds, if you like\u2014mistakes we made, in my judgment, at the very beginning. But I think the Iraqis were heading in the right direction. You had a government that acquired greater national legitimacy. There was a greater Sunni participation in government compared to an earlier period. The level of violence, by the end of the Bush administration, was significantly down compared to 2006, early 2007.\n\nWe\u2019re still talking about Iraq, but relatively speaking, I would say it was on a positive trajectory with some big issues still unresolved.\n\nMC: Kim, tell us more about the security situation when President Obama arrived.\n\nKim Kagan: The security situation in Iraq was dramatically improved by operations conducted by surge troops\u2014violence in Baghdad and in Iraq fell dramatically over the course of 2007. And in 2008, U.S. forces partnered with the Iraqi security forces, pushed AQI out of Baghdad, out of Diyala and all the way to Mosul, where the Al Qaeda elements were greatly reduced over time by follow-on operations and special forces operations. The Shia militias, which posed a threat to the sovereignty of the Iraqi government, had been greatly diminished by the operations that Prime Minister Maliki and U.S. forces undertook in 2008 and were no longer militarily viable within Iraq.\n\nThe two main threats to Iraqi state security had been significantly diminished by 2008 and over the course of 2009. Our U.S. forces were handing over security to Iraqi security forces, such that U.S. forces came out of the major cities of Iraq, and handed responsibility for those cities back to the Iraqi security forces. One of the principles behind the way that the U.S. had constructed its surge operations was that the U.S. had special tie-in capabilities that the Iraqi security forces did not have, because they were still growing, still developing skills. So clearing cities was something the U.S. did with Iraqi security forces\u2019 support.\n\nAs those cities became more peaceful, as the population returned, as AQI left, the Iraqi security forces could handle the security environment in the urban centers. But AQI was not destroyed. It had not lost the will to fight. It was potentially reduced from an organization that had high-end terrorist capabilities that could threaten the state, to an insurgency, a group that had very limited capacity to act as a terrorist organization, but still had some will to fight, and still had some organization, some command and control left over, primarily in the Mosul area.\n\nMC: John, what did the threat to the U.S. or western interests in the region emanating from Iraq look like at the time Obama took office?\n\nJohn McLaughlin:\u00a0If you go all the way back to 2008, the Arab Spring or Awakening was still years away. In 2008, Al Qaeda central was on the run but not defeated. We were still very much on guard against attacks on the United States; we were just two years after detecting the attempt by Al Qaeda-related people to put together an operation over the Atlantic out of London\u2014the planes plot. So Al Qaeda in that period is still very dangerous but not particularly noteworthy insofar as its capability in Iraq was seen.\n\nMC:\u00a0 Ambassador Hill, you get to Iraq at the start of Obama\u2019s first term. What does that Iraq look like\u2014is it on a trajectory to a place where it can stand on its own?\n\nChris Hill:\u00a0There was perhaps more optimism than the facts might have justified. For example, there was a view that somehow Maliki had gotten in the saddle, that he understood the need for outreach to the various groups and was prepared to continue the payments to the so-called Sons of Iraq. There was an overall kind of optimistic mood, but I must say, in talking to the Sunni leaders who were part of his cabinet, you certainly didn\u2019t get the sense there was any reason to be optimistic. You certainly got the impression when you talked to people that it wasn\u2019t going well. Going out to Anbar, for example, and talking to Sunni sheiks out there, they were all prepared to work together in a kind of all-in Sunni party, but you certainly didn\u2019t get the impression they were cutting Baghdad any slack or cutting Maliki any slack.", "297": "Pope Francis, making history\u2019s first papal address to the U.S. Congress, on Thursday implored America\u2019s leaders to accept those born in other countries as their own children, urging lawmakers to set aside political differences and embrace people who \u201ctravel north in search of a better life.\u201d\n\nThe pope wrapped traditional Catholic teachings into a celebration of American icons including Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther King Jr., drawing lessons from their work to gently but firmly push Congress to move beyond the partisan paralysis that has blocked progress on immigration reform, climate change and other issues.\n\n\u201cEach son or daughter of a given country has a mission, a personal and social responsibility,\u201d the 78-year-old pontiff said in heavily accented English. \u201cYour own responsibility as members of Congress is to enable this country, by your legislative activity, to grow as a nation.\u201d\n\nPresident Obama watched the speech on television, according to White House press secretary Josh Earnest. \u201cPope Francis made the appropriate observation for the United States to live up to the high standards that we set for ourselves,\u201d Earnest said.\n\n[LIVE UPDATES: The latest on Pope Francis in America]\n\nThe Capitol Hill call to action kicked off a second full day of gleeful crowds and emotional visits to Catholic institutions. The faithful gathered at the Apostolic Nunciature, or Vatican embassy, to greet the pope when he emerged. More lined the streets as his motorcade traveled to the Capitol, where thousands waited on the Mall to watch his speech on giant screens.\n\nAfter his address to Congress, the pope went directly from the grandeur of Capitol Hill to the spare St. Patrick\u2019s Catholic Church in a neighborhood that has flipped over the past decade from marginalized to magnet. He prayed with people who variously wore suits and torn T-shirts, and he blessed the meals of more than 300 homeless people.\n\nUpon arrival at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, the pope traveled by helicopter and motorcade to a very different St. Patrick\u2019s, the soaring cathedral on Manhattan\u2019s Fifth Avenue, for an evening service.\n\nThere, the pontiff began his homily by expressing \u201cmy sentiments of closeness\u201d with Muslims after the tragic stampede that killed more than 700 pilgrims near Mecca on Thursday, the first day of Eid al-Adha, one of the holiest Muslim holidays. \u201cI unite myself with all prayers to Almighty God, the merciful,\u201d he said.\n\nHe spoke directly to nuns and women in the church, saying, \u201cWhat would the church be without you?\u201d He also referenced the clergy sex scandal for the second time on this visit, lamenting \u201cthe shame\u201d caused by \u201cbrothers who harmed and scandalized the church in the most vulnerable of her members.\u201d\n\nThe pontiff will carry his message to world leaders Friday when he speaks at a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nIn his speech to Congress, Francis crafted an address saturated in American references, with special praise for the nation\u2019s role as \u201ca land which has inspired so many people to dream.\u201d\n\nHe was pointed at times, urging the abolition of the death penalty and the end of arms trading, and warning of the dangers of religious extremism worldwide. And he was oblique at points, never directly mentioning abortion or the United States\u2019 rapid embrace of same-sex marriage, saying only that the family is being threatened and that \u201cfundamental relationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of marriage and the family.\u201d\n\nHe saved his most specific prescription for combating climate change, a cause on which he said the United States has a special obligation to lead.\n\n\u201cI call for a courageous and responsible effort to redirect our steps, and to avert the most serious effects of the environmental deterioration caused by human activity,\u201d the pope said. \u201cI am convinced that we can make a difference \u2014 I\u2019m sure. And I have no doubt that the United States \u2014 and this Congress \u2014 have an important role to play. Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies.\u201d\n\nThe pope, who helped broker a diplomatic opening with Cuba, offered himself and his example as a pastoral link between opposing points of view. \u201cIt is my duty to build bridges and to help all men and women, in any way possible, to do the same,\u201d he said. \u201cA good political leader is one who, with the interests of all in mind, seizes the moment in a spirit of openness and pragmatism.\u201d\n\nAlthough members of Congress largely avoided the ostentatious displays of partisan cheering that have come to characterize the president\u2019s annual State of the Union addresses, an ideological divide was apparent at times. In response to Francis\u2019s passage about climate change, Democrats mostly stood and cheered, while some Republicans stayed seated and applauded mildly, if at all.\n\nBut the response to the pope\u2019s passionate words about embracing immigrants seemed to strike a bipartisan chord. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a presidential candidate and son of Cuban immigrants, wiped away tears as the pope called himself \u201cthe son of immigrants.\u201d\n\n[Pope Francis: \u2018I always was interested in politics\u2019]\n\nPope Francis tempered his call for action with a statement of support for the role that business plays in society, calling it \u201ca noble vocation, directed to producing wealth and improving the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe creation and distribution of wealth,\u201d he said, is a vital element in the fight against poverty and climate change.\n\nThose looking for signs of this pope\u2019s political direction could find evidence in the speech\u2019s repeated references to a pantheon of liberal heroes, from Dorothy Day, who dedicated her life to a battle against poverty and war, to Thomas Merton, whose \u201cLetters to a White Liberal,\u201d written in 1963, urged Christians to follow their faith and join the fight for civil rights for black Americans.\n\nThe pope praised King for his focus on \u201cliberty in plurality and non-exclusion,\u201d Day for \u201csocial justice,\u201d and Merton for \u201cdialogue and openness to God.\u201d\n\n[6 reasons the pope\u2019s speech could be awkward for some lawmakers]\n\nFrancis implored Congress to \u201creject a mind-set of hostility\u201d and embrace the immigrants who come \u201cto this land to pursue their dream of building a future in freedom.\u201d\n\nThe pope, noting that many in Congress are also children of people who made the risky journey to America, said the nation must follow the golden rule and \u201ctreat others with the same passion and compassion with which we want to be treated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe must not be taken aback by their numbers,\u201d he said, \u201cbut rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to their stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation.\u201d\n\nFrancis\u2019s emphasis on immigrants is a matter of self-interest for a U.S. church that is rapidly becoming majority Latino. Parishes across the white Northeast are shuttered while many in the West and South are bursting with \u00adSpanish-language Masses.\n\nThat focus also dovetails with the major theme of his American trip so far, a series of reminders that his papacy is very much about renewing the church\u2019s focus on the poor and the powerless. The pope this year opened a 30-\u00adbedroom homeless shelter just steps from the Vatican. He had showers set up for homeless people in St. Peter\u2019s Square, and he invited about 150 homeless people to a private viewing of the Sistine Chapel.\n\nIn New York, he will get a direct look at inner-city Catholic education when he visits a school in East Harlem and meets with immigrants and refugees. In Philadelphia, where he will end his U.S. visit, the pope will visit a prison to meet with inmates. In Washington, his visit at St. Patrick\u2019s immediately \u2014 and pointedly \u2014 followed his hour in the majestic House chamber. The plain sanctuary of the 220-year-old downtown church was filled with people who need basic life services. But as Francis noted, \u201cIn prayer, there is no first or second class.\u201d\n\n\u201cI need your prayers, your support,\u201d the pontiff said, standing at a simple wooden podium before a reverentially silent flock. \u201cWould you like to pray together?\u201d\n\nThe hush broke like the uncorking of a bottle: \u201cYes!\u201d\n\nAmericans are largely supportive of the pope\u2019s engagement on economic, social and environmental issues. But American Catholics, who make up about one-fifth of the U.S. electorate, remain deeply divided over their church\u2019s directives.\n\n[Poll: Americans love this pope. His church? Not as much]\n\nOne Catholic congressman, Rep. Paul A. Gosar (R-Ariz.), skipped the pope\u2019s appearance to protest Francis\u2019s advocacy for strong action against global climate change and what Gosar sees as the pope\u2019s failure to speak out \u201cwith moral authority against violent Islam.\u201d\n\nThe many lawmakers who were inside the chamber on Thursday emerged with bipartisan agreement that the pope\u2019s central message was simple: Just get along.\n\nOn the Capitol lawn, many of those who watched the pope\u2019s congressional address on giant video screens came away convinced that Congress should \u2014 but probably won\u2019t \u2014 take his message to heart.\n\n\u201cI was not expecting him to address the bipartisan divide,\u201d said Emily Warn, 62, a writer from Seattle. \u201cIt\u2019s as if he was trying to heal Congress.\u201d\n\nIn a country where the old-line Catholic population is diminishing because many families are having fewer children \u2014 though a wave of Hispanic immigrants is partly making up for that decline in numbers \u2014 the pope spoke to young Catholics, especially those who are \u201cdisoriented and aimless, trapped in a hopeless maze of violence, abuse and despair.\u201d\n\nThey will have children, he said, only if the nation provides them with a greater sense of \u201cpossibilities for the future.\u201d\n\nAfter the address, Francis walked through the Capitol\u2019s second floor to Statuary Hall and paused at the statue of Jun\u00edpero Serra, the California missionary whom he had canonized on Wednesday.\n\nThe pontiff then joined Vice President Biden, House Speaker John A. Boehner (R-Ohio) and other congressional leaders on the speaker\u2019s balcony overlooking the West Front of the Capitol, greeting an enthusiastic crowd that numbered in the thousands. He said a few words of thanks in Spanish and then, to great cheers, switched to English: \u201cThank you very much, and God bless America!\u201d\n\nSarah Pulliam Bailey, DeNeen L.

Marco Rubio, R-Florida, and Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, favors extending the law. Final congressional approval of the bill before the deadline is no certainty.\n\nPaul plunged into a lengthy speech declaring the Patriot Act unconstitutional and opposing renewal of the program.

Paul kept control by yielding for questions without \"yielding the floor,\" and by not sitting.\n\nThe surveillance issue has divided Republicans and Democrats, cutting across party lines and pitting civil libertarians concerned about privacy against more hawkish lawmakers fearful about losing tools to combat terrorism.\n\nAs Paul made his case, a Justice Department memo circulated on Capitol Hill warning lawmakers that the NSA will have to begin winding down its bulk collection of Americans' phone records by the end of the week if Congress fails to reauthorize the Patriot Act.\n\n\"After May 22, 2015, the National Security Agency will need to begin taking steps to wind down the bulk telephone metadata program in anticipation of a possible sunset in order to ensure that it does not engage in any unauthorized collection or use of the metadata,\" the department said.\n\nIf Congress fails to act, several key provisions of the law would expire, including the bulk collection; a provision allowing so-called roving wiretaps, which the FBI uses for criminals who frequently switch cellphones; and a third that makes it easier to obtain a warrant to target a \"lone wolf\" terror suspect who has no provable links to a terrorist organization.\n\nLast week, the House backed the USA Freedom Act, which would replace bulk collection with a system to search the data held by telephone companies on a case-by-case basis. The vote was 338-88, and House Republican and Democratic leaders have insisted the Senate act on their bill.\n\nBut McConnell and several other top Republicans prefer to simply reauthorize the post-Sept. 11 law. McConnell has agreed to allow a vote on the House bill, but has indicated there may not be enough votes to pass it in the Senate.\n\nThe Justice Department also said that if Congress allows the law to expire and then passes legislation to reauthorize it when lawmakers return to Washington the week of June 1, it would \"be effective in making the authorities operative again, but may expose the government to some litigation risk in the event of legal challenge.\"\n\nThe White House backs the House bill and has pressed for the Senate to approve the legislation and send it to President Barack Obama for his signature.\n\nThe House bill is the result of outrage among Republicans and Democrats after Snowden's revelations about the NSA program.\n\nAlthough Paul called his action a filibuster, it technically fell short of Senate rules since the bill the Senate was considering was trade, not the Patriot Act.", "300": "China Airport Security Robot Gives Electroshocks 11/02/2016 \nACTIVIST POST \nWhile debate surrounds the threat of autonomous \u201ckiller robots,\u201d the mechanized replacement of humans continues across the workforce. \nThe industrial robotics industry is logging record sales worldwide, and there appears to be no sign of a slowdown. As you can see in the graphic below, 2015 sales surged 12% over a previous record year to reach almost 1/4 million units. \nThere are many factors driving this growth, which you can read about here; but one point worth noting is that the two leading countries are the US and China, with China leading the way. \nThe nature of robotics is also changing, as new developments in artificial intelligence are giving robots an increasing range of potential uses. One key area, of course, is security. Robot security guards have already begun appearing at prisons , care facilities , and schools, in various locations around the world. \nOne U.S. robot company, Gamma 2 Robotics, has designed several models for mass production. Their latest \u2013 RAMSEE \u2013 can be seen in the video below. A true mass roll-out of this fully autonomous security guard could significantly impact the 1.5 million humans that are currently employed in some form of security patrol. \nRAMSEE advertises the following capabilities: Is a physical presence that autonomously patrols without supervision Provides real-time data: intruders, motion, heat, fire, smoke, gases & more Is a human-machine interface that creates a powerful force multiplier \nSignificantly, Gamma 2 Robotics has partnered with Hexagon Safety & Infrastructure: \u201cthe global leader in public safety and security solutions.\u201d \nHowever, RAMSEE is missing one thing: weapons. For that, we have to travel to China, where they seem to have embraced police robots full throttle. \nIn late 2015, I covered an announcement from China\u2019s Xinhua news agency where they announced the development and deployment of 3 weaponized \u201canti-terrorism\u201d robots that would be far more active than a mere patrol: \n\u201cThe toy-sized robots can coordinate with each other on the battlefield,\u201d said the report, following their unveiling at the 2015 World Robot Conference in Beijing. \nThe first model is known as a \u201creconnaissance\u201d robot, which scouts for poisonous gases, dangerous chemicals and explosives before transmitting its findings back to base.If this initial investigation detects a simple bomb is the source of danger, the second robot model \u2013 a small explosive ordnance disposal (EOD) machine \u2013 would be sent in to diffuse it. \nBut with other, more complicated threats, an attacker robot would start its mission, armed with \u201cminor-caliber weapons, recoilless rifles and grenade launchers\u201d. \n\u201cWith a sighting telescope, a trigger and a safe installed, the attacker can hit its target from a long distance,\u201d Xinhua said. \nThe local police force in Beijing was reported to be among the buyers for the three robots , which are priced at 1.5 million yuan (\u00a3156,000) for the set by manufacturers HIT Robot Group, who are based in the northern city of Harbin. \n\u201cApart from anti-terror operations, they can also be applied in fire fighting, public security, forestry and agriculture,\u201d the company\u2019s sales manager Chen Deqiang said, according to Xinhua. \nIf we have learned anything about anti-terrorism efforts, authorities consider front-line deployment to be areas of public travel. We were given the TSA based on such notions, and have since witnessed its intrusive role in airports, and soon-to-be at other public transportation if authorities have their way. \nChina has gone to the next level with a robot TSA of sorts called AnBot that is equipped with what is essentially a taser-like device that is being fittingly compared to a cattle-prod. \nImage Credit \nIt was first introduced at a tech show earlier in the year, and was speculated to have been designed for protest suppression. For now, its first job is to patrol China\u2019s Shenzhen airport. \nMost alarming, however, is that it is tied to one of the most powerful supercomputers on the planet. \nThe back end of this \u201cintelligent security robot\u201d is l inked to China\u2019s Tianhe-2 supercomputer , where it has access to cloud services . AnBot conducts patrols, recognizes threats and has multiple cameras that use facial recognition. \nThese cloud services give the robots petascale processing power , well beyond onboard processing capabilities in the robot. The supercomputer connection is there \u201cto enhance the intelligent learning capabilities and human-machine interface of these devices,\u201d said the U.S.-China Economic and Security Review, in a report released Tuesday that examines China\u2019s autonomous systems development efforts . [emphasis added] \n( Source ) \nThis link to \u201ccloud services\u201d is a new trend in robot artificial intelligence that also has been referred to as the Wikipedia for Robots \u2013 essentially an Internet Cloud Brain. Through robot-to-robot information sharing they can speed up their learning process \u2026 autonomously. Examples have included robots that can learn to cook, and robots that can learn the tasks involved in care-giving. However, when applied to policing, things become much more ethically troubling. \nPeople were outraged in the U.S., for example, when a robot in Dallas was used to deliver a pound of C-4 explosive to a U.S. citizen whom the police deemed a sufficient threat worthy of immediate execution. At least, in that case, a human made the decision. But it is being viewed as a tip-toe along the path to the widespread use of \u201ckiller robots\u201d much as we have seen with the use of drones. Discussion was once limited to overseas \u2013 egregious enough \u2013 but there has been a growing voice of those who are urging weaponized domestic police drones. \nAs John Vibes wrote , it might be inevitable: \nThe Taser corporation is planning on building a drone that is equipped with a stun gun, according to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal. \nNot only will the drones be equipped with tasers, but there is also talk of them being autonomous, meaning that an actual human won\u2019t necessarily be needed to fly the drone. \nThis is actually already being done in India , the first country to have approved the use of drones attached with \u201cnon-lethal\u201d weapons. And, just this week, British tabloid, The Sun , had a feature entitled \u201cVladimir Putin\u2019s Russia is preparing an army of robots and drones to take on its enemies, Deputy PM Dmitry Rogozin admits.\u201d Given the available facts, this title no longer seems so deliberately sensational. \nClearly we are entering a potentially dangerous convergence of expanding robotic artificial intelligence along with the political will to continue allowing robots more and more autonomy as they carry out the traditional duties of the military and police. Some experts argue that the precision of robotics will curb many of the abuses we have seen from our military and police. But is that the trend we are actually seeing? Or will automated systems of violent control inevitably lead to even greater industrial-level suppression and killing? \nNicholas West writes for ActivistPost.com .

The Israeli prime minister has since insisted that he remains open to a two-state solution under very specific, restrictive conditions. But the damage appears to have been done, with the White House offering only the most perfunctory of diplo-speak to obscure its frustrations.\n\n\"We indicated that that kind of rhetoric was contrary to what is the best of Israel's traditions. That although Israel was founded based on the historic Jewish homeland and the need to have a Jewish homeland, Israeli democracy has been premised on everybody in the country being treated equally and fairly,\" said Obama. \"And I think that that is what's best about Israeli democracy. If that is lost, then I think that not only does it give ammunition to folks who don't believe in a Jewish state, but it also I think starts to erode the meaning of democracy in the country.\"\n\nIn his first public comments on Tuesday's elections in Israel, Obama's deepest discomfort was saved for Netanyahu's Election Day warning about Arab Israeli voters going to the polls \"in droves.\"\n\nThough he pledged to keep working with the Israeli government on military and intelligence operations, Obama declined to say whether the United States would continue to block Palestinian efforts to secure statehood through the United Nations. In a phone conversation the two had on Thursday, he said he indicated to Netanyahu that \"it is going to be hard to find a path where people are seriously believing that negotiations are possible.\"\n\n\"We take him at his word when he said that it wouldn't happen during his prime ministership, and so that's why we've got to evaluate what other options are available to make sure that we don't see a chaotic situation in the region,\" the president said in an interview with The Huffington Post on Friday.\n\nWASHINGTON -- President Barack Obama is operating under the assumption that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu does not support the creation of a Palestinian state, despite the Israeli leader's post-election efforts to recast himself as amenable to a two-state solution.\n\nBesides the pressing international matters, Obama also discussed challenges on the domestic front. In forceful terms, he chastised Senate Republicans for holding up his attorney general nominee , Loretta Lynch, and encouraged Democrats to buck demands that they first pass a human trafficking bill with a controversial anti-abortion provision.\n\n\"Our goal,\" he added, \"is to get this done in a matter of weeks, not months.\"\n\nNegotiators took a hiatus for the observation of Nowruz, the Iranian New Year. The president on Friday encouraged everybody involved to use that time to grow more \"comfortable with the current positions that are being taken.\"\n\nStanding in the way of that final deal, according to recent reports, are lingering disputes over limits on new types of centrifuges that Iran wants to develop and the pace of international sanctions relief to be given to the country after a deal is struck.\n\n\"Frankly,\" he said, \"they have not yet made the kind of concessions that are I think going to be needed for a final deal to get done. But they have moved, and so there's the possibility.\"\n\nWhile he expressed worry about the strain that Netanyahu had placed on Israel's democratic fabric, Obama did not see the Israeli prime minister's electoral victory as having a tangible impact on current negotiations over Iran's nuclear program. With just days to go before those talks between Iran, the U.S. and five other countries are scheduled to wrap, Obama offered a markedly sober assessment about the prospects for a deal.\n\nAn even bigger fight between the parties could be on the political horizon. The president flatly said that he would not sign an appropriations bill to fund the government if it did not alleviate the spending cuts brought about by sequestration. With spending cuts set to return in October 2015, his declaration ups the ante for lawmakers and portends another government shutdown showdown.\n\n\"I\u2019ve been very clear. We are not going to have a situation where, for example, our education spending goes back to its lowest level since the year 2000,\" said Obama. \"We can\u2019t do that to our kids, and I\u2019m not going to sign it.\"\n\nEven without Congress' input, there are initiatives that Obama can pursue during his closing year-and-a-half in office. During the roughly 25-minute interview in the White House Cabinet Room, he said that two major ones will be coming.\n\n\"Relatively soon,\" Obama said, he will be raising the annual salary threshold at which companies are required to pay overtime to employees who work more than 40 hours a week. The president didn't tip his hand as to how much he would lift the current level of $23,600.\n\nIn addition, Obama said he would be exercising his pardon and clemency powers \"more aggressively for people who meet the criteria.\" There has been ongoing criticism that he has utilized those powers less than many of his predecessors.\n\nOne place where Obama will not go in the closing months of his second term is back to the negotiating table over a \"grand bargain\" on long-term deficit or debt reduction. Despite Republican criticism that a crisis still looms, he insisted that the times allow for a different approach\n\n\"The truth is, is that circumstances changed,\" said Obama, when asked why he no longer highlights issues like entitlement reform. \"At that time, we were seeing significantly higher deficits, and the economy was just beginning to grow. We now know that we\u2019ve got strong growth.\"\n\nHis unwillingness to re-open those talks he had in 2010 and 2011 isn't indicative of some ideological drift, he added. Asked if he'd become a more progressive president over time -- as recent comments from his former top adviser Dan Pfeiffer indicated -- the president answered, emphatically, \"No.\"\n\n\"What we have done,\" Obama said, \"is consistently looked for additional opportunities to get stuff done. ... By hook or by crook, we're going to make sure that when I leave this office, that the country is more prosperous, more people have opportunity, kids have a better education, we're more competitive, climate change is being taken more seriously than it was, and we are actually trying to do something about it. Those are going to be the measures by which I look back and say whether I've been successful as president.\"", "302": "WikiLeaks: Neera Tanden has ANOTHER ringing endorsement for Hillary! (No, not really) Posted at 3:21 pm on October 29, 2016 by Doug P. \nAs emails released by WikiLeaks have revealed, Hillary Clinton adviser and Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden has demonstrated brutal honesty when it comes to the Clintons\u2019 dealings, and a new email released today is no different: Neera Tanden knows (and she spells like Trump!): \"Sometimes HRC/WJC have the worst judgement\" https://t.co/hRSAhG2eua pic.twitter.com/cTs0oGSb4m", "303": "The first televised presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump was a bonanza for fact checkers. Here are some of the candidates' statements and how they compare with the facts.\n\nClaim: Donald Trump repeated his insistence that he was against the 2003 invasion of Iraq, claiming Clinton's assertions to the contrary were \"mainstream media nonsense put out by her\".\n\nReality Check verdict: Trump did not publicly speak out against the war before it started. On 11 September 2002, radio host Howard Stern asked Trump if he supported a potential invasion of Iraq. He replied: \"Yeah, I guess so\". During the debate, he tried to explain that away by saying the comment had been made \"lightly\". He said he had been arguing in private, to Fox News's Sean Hannity, that war would destabilise the Middle East, but we have no evidence to support that so far. He did start to express doubts after the invasion.\n\nClaim: Clinton attacked Trump over his boasts about his business acumen. \"You know, Donald was very fortunate in his life and that's all to his benefit,\" Clinton said. \"He started his business with $14m, borrowed from his father.\"\n\nReality Check verdict: Trump says he received a $1m loan from his real estate mogul father. He also got loan guarantees and money from his future inheritance and inherited a share of his father's property holdings.\n\nClaim: Trump alleged that Clinton called the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal the \"gold standard\" of trade agreements. Clinton denied this but added: \"I did say I hoped it would be a good deal.\"\n\nReality Check verdict: We give this one to Trump. Clinton did more than express hope that the deal would turn out well and in a 2012 trip to Australia said it would be the \"gold standard\": \"This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field.\"\n\nClaim: Clinton said: \"People have looked at both of our plans, have concluded that mine would create 10 million jobs and yours would lose us 3.5 million jobs.\"\n\nReality Check verdict: Clinton has made this claim before. It is based on an optimistic reading of a report by Moody's Analytics, which says that most of the 10 million new jobs would be created anyway by an expanding economy. If all of Clinton's economic policies became law - which the report says is unlikely - they would account for 3.2 million of the 10 million jobs. The same company analysed Trump's plans and suggested they would tip the US into recession and lead to 3.5 million job losses - something strongly disputed by the Trump campaign.\n\nBut the two reports cover different time frames. The author Mark Zandi told CNN Money a more accurate comparison to the 10 million jobs created under Clinton would be 400,000 jobs lost under Trump, not 3.4 million.\n\nClaim: Trump has frequently tried to blame the rise of Islamic State militants on Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This is his latest attempt.\n\nReality Check verdict: Possibly the strangest claim of the night. Clinton is 68 years old. The so-called Islamic State can trace its roots back to 1999, although it did not start referring to itself as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) until 2013. Read more here.\n\nClaim: Clinton accused Trump of calling calling climate change a hoax invented by the Chinese. He insisted \"I did not say that\".\n\nReality Check verdict: This claim relates to a 2012 tweet which Trump later said was a joke. He said: \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make US manufacturing non-competitive.\"\n\nClaim: Clinton said race determines how people are treated in the criminal justice system.\n\nReality Check verdict: This is a tough one to prove as there are no figures on the percentage of crimes that result in arrest. What we do know is that black people are locked up five times more frequently than white people. African-American people make up about 13% of the United States population. White people make up 64%. But black people make up 40% of the prison population, and white people 39%. It does not mean that black people, who tend to live more in urban, heavily policed areas, are five times as likely to commit crime however.\n\nClinton also claimed that African American men are more likely to be killed by guns than other demographics, something that is largely borne out by the statistics.\n\nClaim: Murders in New York city are up.\n\nReality Check verdict: As so often with crime statistics it depends how you slice it. The murder rate in New York city is close to record lows but did increase slightly between 2014 and 2015, according to FBI figures. But the very latest figures from the New York Police Department show murder rates are down 4% on 2015.\n\nMurder rates across the US as a whole went up 10.8% in 2015, the biggest single-year percentage jump since 1971, with a big spike in a handful of cities including Chicago, Washington DC and Baltimore.\n\nTrump also claimed that \"stop and frisk\" tactics \"worked very well in New York\" and brought crime rates down. This is hotly disputed by researchers and commentators . Violent crime rates have continued to decline in New York, as part of a long term trend, even though the number of \"stop and frisk\" searches has gone down dramatically in recent years. Research by Jeffrey Fagan of Columbia University found indiscriminate searches had little effect on crime, although his research also found crime was reduced when police stopped and frisked civilians after observing someone acting violently, selling drugs or \"casing a joint\".\n\nClaim: Trump says he can't release his tax returns because he is in the middle of a tax audit. He also says publishing them would not reveal much.\n\nClinton suggests he will never publish them as they might reveal he is not as rich as he says he is, does not pay Federal tax and does not give as much to charity as claimed.\n\nReality Check verdict: Being audited by the Internal Revenue Service does not prohibit the release of tax returns. They would reveal Trump's annual income, how much he pays in tax and how much he gives to charity. Trump claims he has given $102m to charity in the past five years, but a Washington Post investigation could not find any cash donated by Trump's businesses after 2008. Trump's actual wealth has been assessed by Forbes at $4.5bn, compared with the $10bn he claims.\n\nInterestingly, Trump has never provided evidence that he is actually under audit by the tax authorities. According to Associated Press, a letter released by his tax lawyers never used the word, merely describing his tax returns as under continuous review.", "304": "Here's   \nThis is what it must feel like to be on Death Row, to be waiting for the moment when the iron door clangs open for the last time and four burly guards escort you arm-in-arm to the room where your life will be extinguished. That same sense of dread hangs over the presidential election of 2016. \nNo one is happy about the election and no one anticipates better days ahead. America\u2019s \u2018glory days\u201d appear to be in the rearview mirror while the steady downward slide seems to be gaining pace. This year\u2019s presidential campaign has brought all the anger, anxiety and frustration bubbling to the surface. Nerves are raw, people are on edge, and the trepidation is so thick you could cut it with a knife. All the recent surveys tell the same story: Americans are sick of the mudslinging, sick of the scandals, sick of the recriminations, sick of the two party duopoly, and sick of the two candidates, the two most distrusted and reviled candidates in the country\u2019s 230 year history. This is from the New York Times: \n\u201cAn overwhelming majority of voters are disgusted by the state of American politics, and many harbor doubts that either major-party nominee can unite the country after a historically ugly presidential campaign, according to the final pre-election New York Times/CBS News Poll\u2026 \nWith more than eight in 10 voters saying the campaign has left them repulsed rather than excited, the rising toxicity threatens the ultimate victor. Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate, and Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, are seen as dishonest and viewed unfavorably by a majority of voters\u2026 \nAfter weeks of Mr. Trump\u2019s accusations that the election is \u201crigged,\u201d a little more than six in 10 of his supporters say they will accept the results as legitimate if he loses. More than a quarter of Mr. Trump\u2019s supporters say they will probably not accept the outcome if Mrs. Clinton is declared the winner, and nearly 40 percent of them say they have little or no confidence that Americans\u2019 votes will be counted properly.\u201d ( Voters Express Disgust Over U.S. Politics in New Times /CBS Poll, New York Times) \nThe growing sense of desperation in America today is palpable and it goes far beyond this one, isolated election cycle. The steady erosion of confidence in the nation\u2019s main institutions is evident in Congress\u2019s public approval ratings which seem to be stuck in single-digit territory. The public probably feels equal contempt for the Loretta Lynch Justice Department which is loaded with Clinton toadies that have done their best to quash any investigation into the illicit pay-to-play machinations at the Clinton Foundation. And, let\u2019s not forget the media which has lost whatever shred of credibility it managed to salvage after its myriad of war-promoting lies about WMD, mobile weapons labs, aluminum tubes and Assad\u2019s imaginary chemical weapons attacks, attacks that were invented from whole cloth at one of Washington\u2019s many neocon think tanks where these fake ideas are typically hatched. The Forth Estate\u2019s latest gambit is an idiotic attempt to prove that Vladimir Putin is trying to hack our thoroughly-corrupted Third World voting system to achieve some nebulous political gain. What a joke. \nNo, Hillary, Putin is not gaming the system like you did in the primaries with Bernie Sanders, nor did he put a gun to your head and force you to delete the 33,000 missing emails from your private server. That was your handiwork Ms. Clinton, although you have a done a masterful job in deflecting attention from yourself and passing the buck for your own sleazy, criminal activities onto Moscow. \nBut, back to the media. This from Gallup: \n\u201cAmericans\u2019 trust and confidence in the mass media \u201cto report the news fully, accurately and fairly\u201d has dropped to its lowest level in Gallup polling history, with 32% saying they have a great deal or fair amount of trust in the media. This is down eight percentage points from last year. \nGallup began asking this question in 1972, and on a yearly basis since 1997. Over the history of the entire trend, Americans\u2019 trust and confidence hit its highest point in 1976, at 72%, in the wake of widely lauded examples of investigative journalism regarding Vietnam and the Watergate scandal. After staying in the low to mid-50s through the late 1990s and into the early years of the new century, Americans\u2019 trust in the media has fallen slowly and steadily. It has consistently been below a majority level since 2007\u2026 \nBottom Line:\u2026the slide in media trust has been happening for the past decade. Before 2004, it was common for a majority of Americans to profess at least some trust in the mass media, but since then, less than half of Americans feel that way. Now, only about a third of the U.S. has any trust in the Fourth Estate, a stunning development for an institution designed to inform the public.\u201d ( Americans\u2019 Trust in Mass Media Sinks to New Low , Gallup) \n\u201cDesigned to inform the public\u201d??? \nYou gotta be kidding? Droopy confidence in the media is a triumph for ordinary working people who have begun to see through the charade of \u201cunbiased coverage\u201d and realize that the corporate owners of the press manipulate the news to shape perceptions and maintain their stranglehold on power. That\u2019s what\u2019s really going on, and that\u2019s why a growing number of people have swarmed to Donald Trump\u2019s campaign. They see Trump\u2019s lack of political correctness as a sign that he is not owned by the Washington oligarchy of racketeers who invent teleprompter candidates like Obama and Clinton who are never certain what they actually believe until they see it printed in bold letters on the screen in front of them. ORDER IT NOW \nTo large extent, Trump owes his shocking rise to the top of the GOP ticket to the fact that he shoots from the hip and that the media hates him. What was once a liability, has become an asset as trust for the despised media has plunged to depths never seen before. \nBut that doesn\u2019t explain what\u2019s really driving this election and why are the American people so overcome by desperation? \nIt\u2019s all about economic insecurity. It\u2019s all about the fact that standards of living are slipping, that an entire generation is bogged down with student debt, that all the good-paying jobs have been shipped to other countries, that family incomes are shriveling, that a good portion of the population feel threatened by immigration, that health care costs have skyrocketed, that retirement plans have been postponed, and that the great bulk of the nation\u2019s wealth has been transferred to the 1 percent plutocrats and Wall Street landsharks who dictate policy through their Congressional lackeys and their allies at the Federal Reserve. That\u2019s what the election is really all about. \nPeople are waking up to the fact that the American dream is dead, that the US is no longer the land of opportunity, and that the lives of their children are going to be worse than their own, far worse. This is why everyone is so upset, so frustrated, so hopeless. They are looking for a political ally who will address their needs, and instead they get bromides on transgender bathrooms or \u201cglass ceilings\u201d or any of the other soothing slogans the Democrats use to pacify the masses and to keep them in the flock. Only now it\u2019s not working as well. Now a sizable portion of the blue collar vote has shifted into Trump\u2019s camp mainly because they see through the phony Democrat rhetoric and all the job-eviscerating free trade deals they\u2019ve pushed for years. Trump has skillfully tapped into the collective psyche of millions of working people who feel the Democratic Party tossed them under the track-hoe 30 years ago and never looked back. And, he\u2019s right, too. The Dems have sold out their supporters, and it\u2019s only going to get worse under Clinton, or should we say, Madame TPP. Here\u2019s how Nile Bowie summed it up in a recent article at CounterPunch: \n\u201cEconomic disempowerment and political disenfranchisement have accelerated under President Obama, to the detriment of the American middle class. White, blue-collar Americans have witnessed the offshoring of their jobs and the erosion of their status in society, and Trump has masterfully stroked their resentment and discontent by playing on their fears of Muslims, immigrants and minorities\u2026 \nTrump\u2019s real problem with the Washington establishment is that he isn\u2019t part of it. His campaign represents an insurgent faction of the oligarchical class that aims to displace and replace the standing political elites. Bipartisan opposition to Trump is grounded in the belief that he would be an unreliable proxy and a liability, someone too narrow and unpredictable to manage the common affairs of the ruling class and the US deep state. \nMoreover, the US establishment is not interested in being led by such a contentious figure, who would draw protest and public opposition in a way that more conventional establishment candidates largely do not. For example, Trump\u2019s rhetoric on immigration seems to engender more public outrage than the immigration policy under Obama, who has deported more people than any other president in history.\u201d ( Election 2016: A Political System In Crisis , Nile Bowie, CounterPunch) \nThe big money guys don\u2019t like Trump, and they make no bones about it. But Trump isn\u2019t going away and neither are his followers, a vast number of whom will not respect the results of the election if Hillary wins. That\u2019s a big problem for elites who like to manage the population through the popular election sham. Now all that\u2019s at risk. \nAnd it\u2019s not like Trump hasn\u2019t bent over backwards to ingratiate himself with the deep-state powerbrokers either. He has. His first olive branch to the elites was the selection of Mike Pence as his running mate. Pence is a died-in-the-wool establishment Republican neocon who can be trusted to pursue the same extremist agenda the GOP has followed since the Gingrich revolution. But there was another big move that Trump made that escaped the notice of the media and which really underscores his willingness to \u201cplay by to the rules.\u201d Here\u2019s the story from Zero Hedge: \n\u201cSix months ago, Steven Mnuchin became finance chair for the Trump campaign. Having successfully helped to raise 10s of millions of dollars for the campaign, the former Goldman Sachs partner and Soros Fund management employee is now positioned for something much larger as Donald Trump reportedly told his aides today that he wants Mnuchin to serve as his Treasury Secretary. \nIronically, Trump has often criticized Clinton (and his former competitor Ted Cruz) for their links to the big banks: \u201cI know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total control over him. Just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton,\u201d Trump said in one debate. But as we noted previously, he had no qualms, however, in hiring one of the most prominent Goldman alums to raise money for him. \u2026for Trump, a self-professed \u201canti-establishment\u201d candidate, who has repeatedly stated he is not \u201cfor sale to special interest groups\u201d, his sudden call for the seemingly most \u201cWall Street\u201d of Wall-Streeters to become Treasury Secretary may come as a big surprise to some and will leave many of his supporters demanding an explanation.\u201d ( Trump Wants Former Goldman Partner And Soros Employee To Serve As Treasury Secretary , Zero Hedge) Another head of Treasury from G-Sax? \nThat figures. \nTrump is great with the rabble-rousing \u201ctake back your country\u201d tirades and all the gibberish about the \u201crigged\u201d system. But he also knows how to cave in when it suits his interests. He knows he\u2019s not going to be president without Wall Street\u2019s nod, so he\u2019s enlisted a trusted insider to take care of business at Treasury. It\u2019s a signal to the bigwigs that they don\u2019t have to worry about the Donald going off the reservation. (wink, wink) So much for Trump\u2019s independence, eh? \nAnd what can we say about Hillary Clinton that hasn\u2019t been said a million times before? \nClinton, who still holds a slim lead in most of the polls, is clearly the establishment candidate in a year when hatred for the corrupt Washington oligarchy, has reached levels not seen in the last hundred years. The fact that Hillary can run for the nation\u2019s highest office while being investigated by the FBI, while being savaged by the daily releases of new, incriminating emails (from WikiLeaks), and while promoting a hawkish, neocon-driven foreign policy that portends a direct military confrontation with Russia, speaks to the fact that traditional liberal Democrats are either still hoodwinked by the Democratic Party\u2019s manipulation of identity politics or simply terrified of the alternative, Donald Trump. \nAnd that\u2019s why everyone is so utterly dejected and depressed about the election, because instead of voting for a candidate they really want or admire, most people are simply voting for the candidate that either disgusts or scares the hell out of them the least. What kind of choice is that? \nIn less than 48 hours, the most agonizingly-wretched campaign of all times will be over, the ballots will be counted, and the new president will be named. The only thing that is certain is that, whoever wins, we lose. \nMIKE WHITNEY lives in Washington state. He is a contributor to Hopeless: Barack Obama and the Politics of Illusion (AK Press).

Here, the Mischiefs of Faction writers offer their quick reactions.\n\nI think Boehner's resignation is more notable for when it occurred than for that it occurred. He had been speaker or minority leader for almost a decade, and clearly no longer relished his job. I think that the next speaker will face the same obstacles that confronted Boehner, particularly a \"no compromise\" faction of conservatives. They cannot be satisfied with policy substance, since they mostly care about tactical extremism. They have also made it clear that they have little interest in the sort of \"pork barrel\" politics that members traditionally have seen as a means to reelection.\n\nI don't think this situation will change until there is a Republican in the White House, since the Tea Partiers object to the slightest accommodation of President Obama or any Democratic successor. There's also a whole industry now devoted to feeding conservatives' belief that their leadership has sold them out. This includes talk radio, bloggers, and groups such as Heritage Action. Perhaps a leader with a warmer relationship with movement conservatives might be a more effective speaker. I'm skeptical that much will change soon.\n\nJohn Boehner has finally decided to take his ball and go home. Of course, I understand why he is resigning: The House GOP is ungovernable right now. Thus, while it is an understandable decision, it is not a \"selfless\" one, as\u00a0several members have described it. No, this is Boehner's coup de grace, executed with deftness. Now free to rely on Democratic votes when necessary, he will be able to keep the government open. In the same way, he might be able to pass other legislation in the next month. More importantly, he presents his fractured caucus with a parting \"gift\" of their own making: selecting their next leader. Beyond the obvious question of who will be the next speaker (probably Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California), really interesting questions raised by Boehner's decision include how the process will work out: Will other Republicans step forward and challenge McCarthy for the job? Will the GOP caucus ultimately come together behind a single candidate? If not, what will the Democrats do?\u00a0As unexpected and exciting as today's surprise announcement is, this is probably going to get much more interesting before all is said and done.\n\nJohn Boehner's resignation as speaker of the House is a good illustration of how American political parties are strong and how they are not. US political parties are not strong in the top-down sense. Neither presidents nor congressional leaders have a lot of control over backbenchers in their parties. The main reason is that these leaders don't control party nominations. While parties have become \"stronger\" since the 1970s, they have become stronger from the bottom up, not the top down.\n\nPresidents don't have much better ability to force legislators to do what they want now (when party line votes are the norm) than they did in the 1950s, '60s, and '70s (when party line votes were rarer). What changed? The power to shape legislative behavior comes from the bottom up. Not just from ordinary voters (although\u00a0those are influential), but also from organized interest groups and wealthy donors in the legislator's district and in their party's national constituency. These factions are what really influence legislators and create party unity, not their party leaders in Washington.\n\nSo why is there so much party unity now, when there wasn't in the 1970s? Now the parties are sorted ideologically. All the legislators who come from conservative districts and are backed by conservative interests groups are Republicans, while all those from liberal districts and backed by liberal interest groups are Democrats. So, unlike the 1970s, a party leader now presides over an ideologically unified caucus that usually votes together. Yet that doesn't mean that he or she has much more direct power over them than leaders did in the decades after World War II.\n\nSpeakers' jobs were actually more secure in the post\u2013World War II era when they led ideologically diverse parties and party control rarely changed hands. The last speaker of the House to retire by choice because of age was Tip O'Neill, who left in 1986. All subsequent speakers have left because of internal party revolts, personal scandals, or electoral disappointments. It is a challenging job, because while US political parties are strong, the power largely does not rest in the congressional leadership. Politicians are loyal to their parties' voters and organized factions, not to their legislative leaders in DC.\n\nThe longstanding tension within congressional parties is that legislators need to cooperate with their parties to accomplish their shared goals, but to do so they must overcome the inherent diversity of American parties.\n\nSince 2010, the House GOP has provided a brilliant demonstration of this tension. The rules of the House, and the Republican conference, provided Boehner with a great deal of power. But his \"majority\" included a sizable number of legislators who would not or could not cooperate with their party. They had campaigned against the party status quo. They promised not to vote for compromises. They promised outcomes they could not realistically achieve with a majority in one chamber (e.g. repealing Obamacare). They feared a primary challenge from the right more than losing to a Democrat.\n\nIt is likely that the next speaker will suffer from the same challenge because the challenge is systemic. The best chance to end the cycle, however, would be for the House GOP to select someone who is trusted by the Tea Party faction both inside and outside of Congress, so that when s/he says, \"That's a stupid strategy that will fail, resulting in a drop in the polls and a humiliating acceptance of the Democrats' demands,\" they will actually trust the speaker.\n\nThe nationalization of congressional politics has changed what it means to try to lead a congressional party. What we like to call leadership \u2014 for speakers, for presidents, whatever \u2014 often amounts to reading the interests and preferences of different actors and figuring out how to bring them into a coalition to support policy that includes a little something for everyone. Pet projects and distribution of resources (that is, what we used to know as \"pork\") can help this process along. But if legislators' preferences are driven by national issues like defunding Planned Parenthood and opposing the president, then the job of coalition building becomes that much more challenging. Boehner may not have been the most talented legislative leader, but his problems, as Greg indicates, are also structural and systemic. And to the extent that they reflect the infusion of national \u2014 and often symbolic \u2014 issues into congressional elections, they may run deeper than the Tea Party-establishment split.\n\nThis post is part of Mischiefs of Faction, an independent political science blog featuring reflections on the party system.

It is the state's chief justice.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014\u00a0When the Supreme Court declared a constitutional right to same-sex marriage last June, the man\u00a0who won the leading case warned that opponents would find new ways to push back.\n\n\u201cWe will have to continue the fight,\u201d Jim Obergefell said then \u2014 and he was right.\n\nFor nearly a year, seesaw battles over religious exemptions and transgender rights have\u00a0replaced what had been the gay rights movement's steady progress in winning protections against discrimination in states and cities. Legislative and legal skirmishes have been triggered\u00a0by an intransigent Alabama chief justice\u00a0and a defiant Kentucky county clerk, a Colorado baker and a Washington State florist, and most recently a conservative backlash that has traveled east from Texas to Mississippi to North Carolina.\n\n\"We never thought this had to do with just marriage,\" says Kristen Waggoner, senior vice president of legal advocacy at Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents many gay rights opponents in court.\u00a0\"This is about more than marriage.\u201d\n\nIt's also about more than bathrooms, although a\u00a0North Carolina law that denies transgender people the right to use public restrooms corresponding to their gender identity has dominated the LGBT rights debate for the past two months:\n\nAcross the country, the gay rights movement has been met with local opposition \u2014\u00a0sometimes where it was least expected, such as Houston, which had three times elected a lesbian mayor. That has forced the movement\u00a0back on the defensive less than a year after its greatest success:\u00a0the Supreme Court's 5-4 decision in\u00a0Obergefell v. Hodges\u00a0that extended same-sex marriage nationwide.\n\n\u201cTo some, this is the next front in the war,\" says David Stacy, government affairs director at the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest gay rights organization.\u00a0\u201cSome of the intensity on the other side, some of the emotional intensity, comes from that.\u201d\n\nBoth sides in the battle say it's about individual rights \u2014 LGBT rights to live free from discrimination, and religious or moral rights to live free from government interference. It extends to education, employment and\u00a0housing \u2014 and it may not be long before a lawsuit is headed back to the Supreme Court.\n\n\u201cI think this moment is going to be\u00a0short-lived, but a lot of damage can be done in this moment,\"\u00a0says Shannon Minter, legal director at the National Center for Lesbian Rights.\u00a0\u201cIt will ultimately be up to the Supreme Court\u00a0to decide whether Title VII (of the Civil Rights Act) and\u00a0Title IX (of the Education Amendments Act)\u00a0fully protect transgender people, and for that matter gay people.\"\n\nJustice Anthony Kennedy's historic ruling on same-sex marriage included a single paragraph warning of the war to come.\n\n\"The First Amendment ensures that religious organizations and persons are given proper protection as they seek to teach the principles that are so fulfilling and so central to their lives and faiths, and to their own deep aspirations to continue the family structure they have long revered,\" Kennedy conceded. \"The same is true of those who oppose same-sex marriage for other reasons.\"\n\nThose battles had begun long before the Supreme Court's decision. In states where same-sex marriage already was legal,\u00a0merchants who\u00a0refused\u00a0to participate in\u00a0gay and lesbian weddings based on religious objections\u00a0were the targets of lawsuits. Most of them lost the early rounds and have appealed.\n\nThe first major sign of resistance\u00a0after the high court's ruling came out of left field. Voters in Houston, where Mayor Annise Parker in 2010 became one of the first openly gay mayors of a major U.S. city, rejected a City Council-passed\u00a0ordinance to protect residents based on characteristics that included sexual orientation and\u00a0gender identity. The simple slogan: \"No Men in Women's Bathrooms.\"\n\n\"They identified an opening and exploited it,\" says\u00a0James Esseks, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's LGBT efforts.\n\nThen this year, state legislatures in South Dakota, Georgia, Mississippi and North Carolina passed laws pushing back against LGBT rights. The bills were vetoed by Republican governors Dennis Daugaard in South Dakota and Nathan Deal in Georgia\u00a0but signed by Mississippi's Phil Bryant\u00a0and North Carolina's Pat McCrory.\n\nMississippi's law protects those who deny services based on religious objections to gay marriage or transgender people. North Carolina's prevents the state and its municipalities from establishing civil rights protections based on sexual orientation or gender identity.\n\n\"You're seeing an explosion of religious liberty legislation in the wake of Obergefell,\" says Mat Staver, chairman of Liberty Counsel, a conservative\u00a0law firm and think tank involved in the effort. He calls it \"just the tip of the iceberg of what we will see as Obergefell begins to settle on the rest of the country.\u201d\n\nThe fight reached the floor of the House of Representatives this month\u00a0over an amendment intended to ban federal contractors from firing workers who are\u00a0gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. The measure was blocked, then passed, then blocked again.\n\nBeset by such conflicts, gay rights advocates have made little\u00a0progress in the past year on their major\u00a0post-gay marriage agenda:\u00a0passing state laws protecting the LGBT community against discrimination in employment, housing and public accommodations.\n\nUtah was the 22nd\u00a0state to pass such a law in March 2015. Since then, gay rights activists have met a wall of opposition in the remaining\u00a028\u00a0states, mostly led by Republican governors and legislatures.\n\n\u201cPeople are using Obergefell now to say 'I can get married on a Sunday, but then I can go into work and get fired on the next day,\u201d says Travis Weber, director of the center for religious liberty at the conservative\u00a0Family Research Council.\n\n Even so, he says,\u00a0\"There\u2019s a need to protect religious dissenters.\u201d\n\nThe\u00a0two sets of legal skirmishes\u00a0\u2014 over religious exemptions\u00a0and transgender rights \u2014 \"have made it difficult for us to move forward,\" Esseks says. He calls them \"responses to the reality of the freedom to marry nationwide.\"\n\nThere have been some victories for LGBT rights. Last month, a federal appeals court in Richmond ruled in favor of a transgender boy's right to sue a Virginia school district over its bathroom policy. A\u00a0handful of states, led by New York, have banned the use of controversial conversion therapy\u00a0on minors.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not as though we\u2019re not making any legislative progress. We are,\" Minter says. Even the prospect of passing non-discrimination laws in 'red'\u00a0states, he says, \"is actually much less daunting after Obergefell than it was before.\u201d\n\nBut energized by their loss at the Supreme Court last June, religious objectors are fighting back amidst\u00a0a presidential election that has divided the country along geographical, ideological and cultural lines.\n\n\"What\u2019s at stake right now is so much bigger than whether someone has to shower with someone of the opposite sex,\u201d Waggoner says. \"I think Obergefell\u00a0opened that door more broadly than it had been before.

Kevin McCarthy stunned Washington with another development in the race for speaker of the House \u2013 the front-runner announced\u00a0Thursday\u00a0that he was dropping out \u2013 names of new candidates began circulating.\n\nInevitably, the chatter quickly reached Rep. Paul Ryan (R) of Wisconsin \u2013 former vice presidential candidate, chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, and budget hawk who many members believe is the person most capable of uniting the deeply divided and turbulent House Republican conference.\n\nBut Chairman Ryan promptly put down this second attempt to draft him. As his Texan GOP colleague, Rep. Blake Farenthold tweeted:\n\nCan you blame him? The speakership is one of the toughest jobs in Washington \u2013 especially this speakership, which is tasked with trying to end or contain a Republican civil war in the chamber.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to take a lot of gumption and a lot of finesse and talent to bridge the gap. So yeah, it\u2019s a difficult chore that very few people are willing to take on,\u201d Rep. Harold Rogers (R) of Kentucky told a scrum of reporters\u00a0Thursday\u00a0afternoon.\n\nJust hours earlier, majority leader McCarthy, an affable Californian known for his listening skills and outreach, capitulated in the face of revolt from the hard-line House Freedom Caucus. Its 40 or so members were set to vote against him in secret balloting.\n\nHis unscripted comments about the political nature of the Benghazi special committee, which is calling\u00a0Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton to testify later this month, also played a role in his decision, he said. McCarthy was attacked from all sides for that comment, from Democrats, Republicans, and the media, when he was tagged as a future speaker who can\u2019t speak.\n\nMcCarthy was likely to survive the hard-liner defection\u00a0Thursday, and win the majority support from his GOP conference needed to nominate him for the speakership. But it was not at all clear that he could win the 218 votes needed to elect the speaker on the House floor later this month.\n\nStanding before cameras in the brightly lit marbled lobby of the Longworth House Office Building,\u00a0his wife beside him, the leader capitulated. \u201cWe\u00a0need a new face.\u2026 If we're going to be strong, we gotta be 100 percent united,\" he said.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s too much anger,\u201d McCarthy told Congressman Rogers, after taking himself out of the running at the closed-door balloting session, according to\u00a0 Roll Call. The Washington Post reported members crying at the news.\n\n\u201cWho knows what\u2019ll happen. People are crying, they don\u2019t have any idea how this will unfold, at all,\u201d Rep. Peter King (R) of New York, told the Post.\n\nWhat most people see of the speakership is what shows up on television. But the job carries awesome responsibility: second in line to the presidency, manager of the Capitol complex, presiding officer of the House. And that\u2019s the easy part.\n\nThen there\u2019s the role of chief messenger of your party, shaping the agenda, and trying to keep your members in line every day to cross the 218-vote threshold \u2013 the number of votes it takes to pass a bill in the 435-member body. And don\u2019t forget incessant fundraising, which takes up most weekends. Oh, and negotiating with the White House and Senate.\n\nThen add the \u201chell no\u201d caucus of 40 to 50 right-wingers to this mix.\n\nThe hard-liners drove Speaker John Boehner (R) of Ohio to announce his early retirement for\u00a0Oct. 30. In light of the decision of his No. 2 to withdraw, Speaker Boehner says he will stay on \u201cuntil the House votes to elect a new speaker.\u201d McCarthy says he is willing to stay on as leader. No date has been set for another leadership\u00a0election.\n\nSome Republicans want Boehner to finish out his term as a congressman and speaker.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very difficult job and having someone like John Boehner there who has a lot of experience and has the courage to do what\u2019s right \u2026 is a good thing,\u201d says Rep. Carlos Curbelo (R) of Florida.\n\nCongressman Curbelo, who describes the speakership as \u201cmore difficult than being the president,\u201d says he doesn\u2019t see any candidate from either party able to get 218 votes.\n\nThat hasn\u2019t stopped new names from being floated, even while the other two candidates \u2013 Rep. Daniel Webster of Florida, backed by the Freedom Caucus, and Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, the chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee \u2013 kept their hats in the ring.\n\nRight-wingers were pleased to see McCarthy drop out. They see him as \"Boehner 2.0.\"\u00a0In a statement, the Freedom Caucus said it respects his decision to \"put the conference ahead of himself\" and said the next speaker \"needs to yield back power to the membership.\"\n\nThe Republican caucus is going through a period of transition, says John Feehery, former spokesman to Dennis Hastert (R) of Illinois, the longest serving Republican speaker. McCarthy represented a new generation of leaders in the House,\u00a0where nearly half of the members have served four years or less.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re going to have to chart their own course and they\u2019re going to have to figure out how the House works together, and they\u2019re going to make mistakes,\" he says.\n\nThat\u2019s one way to learn.", "310": "As Iowans prepare to cast the first votes in the presidential nominating process Monday, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders hoped to defy the polls and pull off upset victories in Monday night's caucuses.\n\nAfter months of campaigning and more than $150 million spent on advertising, the race for supremacy in Iowa is close in both parties.\n\nAmong Republicans, the latest polls show real estate billionaire Donald Trump holding a slim edge over Cruz. Cruz, who became the first major candidate from either party to enter the presidential race 315 days ago, has pinned his hopes to a sophisticated get-out-the-vote operation. Cruz has also\u00a0modeled his campaign after past Iowa winners, visiting all of the state's 99 counties and courting influential evangelical and conservative leaders.\n\n\"If you had told me 10 months ago that the day before the Iowa caucuses we'd be in a statistcal tie for first place I would have been thrilled and exhilarated,\" Cruz told Fox News late Sunday.\n\nThe Republican caucus is also the\u00a0first test of whether Trump can turn the legion of fans drawn to his plainspoken populism into voters. The scope of the billionaire's organization in Iowa is a mystery, though Trump himself has intensified his campaign schedule during the final sprint, including a pair of rallies Monday.\n\n \n\n \"I don't have to win it,\" Trump said on CBS' \u201cFace the Nation\" Sunday. \"I'm doing really well with the evangelicals in Iowa. But I'm also doing tremendously well all over the country with the evangelicals. \u2026 I think we have a good chance of winning Iowa.\"\n\nBy contrast, Cruz told Fox News, \"We're not finding Trump's troops on the ground. \u200eThey don't have an organization that is perceptible.\"\n\nCruz has also spent the closing days of the Iowa campaign focused on Marco Rubio, trying to ensure the Florida senator doesn't inch into second place. Rubio is viewed by many Republicans as a more mainstream alternative to Trump and Cruz, though he'll need to stay competitive in Iowa in order to maintain his viability.\n\n\n\nOn the Democratic side, Sanders has rallied to close a 40-point polling deficit against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, reviving memories of her disappointing showing in Iowa eight years ago.\n\n\"Stick with me,\" Clinton said as she rallied supporters Sunday in Council Bluffs. \"Stick with a plan. Stick with experience.\"\n\nSanders, whose crowds have been large and generally younger than Clinton's, urged voters to help him \"make history\".\u00a0In a show of financial strength, Sanders' campaign announced Sunday it had raised $20 million in January alone.\u00a0While Sanders has a large team in Iowa, his operation got off to a later start, particularly compared with Clinton, who has had staff on the ground in the state for nearly a year.\n\n\"I think we have a shot to win it, if people come out,\" Sanders told ABC's \"This Week.\" The self-described democratic socialist's message that the U.S. economy is\u00a0\u201crigged\u201d against the middle class has appeared to resonate with an electorate that has grown frustrated with Washington and given rise to insurgent candidates like Sanders and Trump.\n\n \n\n The campaigns were anxiously keeping an eye on the weather, but a snowfall forecast to start Monday night appeared more likely to hinder the hopefuls in their rush out of Iowa than any potential voters. Republican John Kasich already had decamped to New Hampshire Sunday, with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush scheduled to follow Monday afternoon, hours before the caucuses start.\n\nThe trio of governors has had a light footprint in Iowa, banking instead on strong showings in New Hampshire's Feb. 9 primary to jumpstart their White House bids. Yet some Republican leaders worry that if Trump or Cruz pull off a big victory in Iowa, it would be difficult to slow their momentum.\n\n\n\nUnlike in primaries, where voters can cast their ballots throughout the day, the caucuses begin across Iowa at 7 p.m. CST.\n\nDemocrats will gather at 1,100 locations and Republicans at nearly 900 spots.\n\n\n\nTurnout was expected to be high. The Iowa Republican Party expected GOP turnout to top the previous record of 120,000 people in 2012. Democrats also expect a strong turnout, though not nearly as large as the record-setting 240,000 people who caucused in the 2008 contest between Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards.\n\n\n\nIowa has decidedly mixed results in picking the parties' eventual nominees. The past two Republican caucus winners -- former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum -- faded as the race stretched on. But Obama's unexpected 2008 victory was instrumental in his path to the nomination, easing the anxieties of those who worried the young black senator would struggle to win white voters.\n\n\n\nWhile both parties caucus on the same night, they do so with different rules.\n\n\n\nRepublicans vote by private ballot. The state's 30 Republican delegates are awarded proportionally based on the statewide vote.\n\n\n\nDemocrats take a more interactive approach, with voters forming groups and publicly declaring their support for a candidate. If the number of people in any group is fewer than 15 percent of the total, they can either choose not to participate or can join another viable candidate's group.\n\n\n\nThose numbers are awarded proportionately, based on statewide and congressional district voting, as Iowa Democrats determine their 44 delegates to the national convention.\n\n \n\n Fox News Channel's Carl Cameron and the Associated Press contributed to this report.", "311": "\n\n Another deadline lapsed Thursday in the seemingly endless negotiations over Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons programs.\u00a0 From Vienna Secretary of State John Kerry warned \"if the tough decisions don\u2019t get made, we are absolutely prepared to call an end to this process.\u201d\u00a0 That would be a mistake.\u00a0 We should instead keep negotiating without reaching a deal \u2014 it\u2019s the best outcome available now.\n\nIran\u2019s inability to say yes to several very good deals it has been offered suggests the negotiations may be a satisfactory end in itself for the government of Iran.\u00a0 They have already achieved some sanctions relief.\u00a0 They get the stature of being Secretary of State Kerry\u2019s full-time job.\u00a0 Their regional enemies are publicly feuding with Washington and questioning our commitment to their security.\u00a0 It\u2019s not a bad outcome for Ayatollah Khameni, especially if he fears the domestic political repercussions of reintegrating with the world.\n\nThe agreement being haggled over in Vienna by Iran, Russia, China, Britain, France, Germany, and the United States will not eliminate Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons program.\u00a0 What is under discussion is how much nuclear infrastructure to let Iran keep, how extensive will be our inspections of what remains, and how much to give them for the privilege.\n\nInspections are the key to any agreement focused on reducing the threat of Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons programs.\u00a0 Technically, the agreement is seeking to increase \u201cbreak out time\u201d: how long it would take Iran using the known equipment and nuclear materials to construct a nuclear bomb.\u00a0 These negotiations are seeking to increase Iran\u2019s break out time from it\u2019s currently estimated 2-3 months to a year.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that we don't honestly know how long it would take Iran to make a nuclear weapon.\u00a0 Not for lack of effort by our intelligence services, but most of what we do know about Iranian nuclear weapons programs was revealed to us, and there remains much we do not know about past and current Iranian programs.\u00a0 We should be deeply skeptical that we know the extent of Iran\u2019s nuclear weapons work or have accounted for all its facilities.\n\nThe Congress has long been a force for good on Iran policy, erecting sanctions for which the Obama administration now takes credit.\n\nSenators Corker and Cardin have ensured that if there is an agreement in Vienna, the Congress will now have 60 days to review the president\u2019s handiwork, which is something the administration had desperately tried to avoid.\n\nSecretary Kerry published his understanding of the framework for agreement concluded in April; any further concessions will be carefully scrutinized. Many of the arguments made by the White House so far in defense of the agreement will not hold up under careful questioning.\n\nAny agreement reached will ease sanctions on Iran, and Russia will surely never agree to reinstate them, no matter how outrageous Iranian cheating on the deal.\u00a0 So sanctions will be unrecoverable.\u00a0 Since much of the Iranian economy is organized to benefit the Revolutionary Guards and citizen militia, they will be the primary beneficiaries of the $100 billion in revenue resulting from lifting just the nuclear weapons related sanctions.\n\nAn Iran deal would solve a political problem for President Obama: he committed to prevent Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon yet so very clearly does not want to have to use military force against Iran. A nuclear deal solves his problem as a political matter, but has already created security problems as regional allies hedge against his intentions.\n\nA continuing negotiation not harried by deadlines might vitiate some of the insecurity.\u00a0 It prevents us lifting sanctions that will be impossible to put back once removed.\u00a0 It provides exposure we did not have to Iranian leaders and perhaps intelligence on their nuclear infrastructure.\u00a0 It keeps us aligned with the three European Union states whose sanctions have been an essential constraint on the Iranian government.\u00a0 It makes more difficult Russian and Chinese support to Iran.\u00a0 And it leaves us free to conduct espionage of the kind that has prevented Iran from crossing the nuclear threshold so far as we know.\n\nIran doesn\u2019t appear to have made the fundamental choice to give up its nuclear weapons programs.\u00a0 Until it does, continuing negotiations is a better outcome than an agreement.\n\nKori Schake is a Hoover Institution Research Fellow at Stanford University and a contributor to Foreign Policy\u2019s Shadow Government blog.", "312": ". NAZI Flying Saucers & A Permanent Base in Antarctica A highly guarded secret is the probablity that German Nazis, as early as the 1930s, have built a sec... Print Email http://humansarefree.com/2016/11/nazi-flying-saucers-permanent-base-in.html A highly guarded secret is the probablity that German Nazis, as early as the 1930s, have built a secret base at the South Pole. While this idea undoubtedly will strike most people as absurd, there is tantalizing evidence to suggest that something along this line might have some truth to it.Long-standing banking and business connections allowed high-ranking German leaders in 1944 to forge a formidable Nazi-controlled organization for postwar activities.Author Jim Keith wrote:\"...in researching the shape of totalitarian control during this century, I saw that the plans of the Nazis manifestly did not die with the German loss of World War II. \"The ideology and many of the principal players survived and flourished after the war, and have had a profound impact on postwar history, and on events taking place today.\"Orvis A. Schmidt, the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s director of Foreign Funds Control, in 1945 offered this description of a Nazi flight-capital program:The network of trade, industrial, and cartel organizations has been streamlined and intermeshed, not only organizationally but also by what has been officially described as \u2018Personnel Union\u2019.Legal authority to operate this organizational machinery has been vested in the concerns that have majority capacity in the key industries such as those producing iron and steel, coal and basic chemicals. These concerns have been deliberately welded together by exchanges of stock to the point where a handful of men can make policy and other decisions that affect us all.Could one of those \"decisions\" have been the creation of a Nazi base connected to the development of UFOs? While this notion may superficially appear to be sheer nonsense, the public record offers compelling \u2014 if incomplete \u2014 evidence to support this idea.One theory is that Martin Bormann and other top Nazis escaped to South America and on to a secret base in Antarctica \u2014 renamed Neuschwabenland by the Germans \u2014 where they built UFOs so sophisticated that their secret Nazi empire has exerted significant control over world events and governments to this day. Read: Hitler Escaped to Argentina & Died Old: Pictures of Him After the War, FBI Documents, DNA Analysis of Skull & Pictures of His House Reportedly, German Navy Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz stated in 1943:\"The German submarine fleet is proud of having built for the F\u00fchrer in another part of the world a Shangri-La on land, an impregnable fortress.\"And it has been reported that U.S. Admiral Richard Byrd , upon his return from an expedition to Antarctica in 1947, stated it was,\"necessary for the USA to take defensive actions against enemy air fighters which come from the polar regions\" and that America could be \"attacked by fighters that are able to fly from one pole to the other with incredible speed.\"Advancing the idea that the Nazis continually shipped men and material to the South Pole throughout the war years, author R. A. Harbinson wrote:\"Regarding the possibility of the Germans building self-sufficient underground research factories in the Antarctic, it has only to be pointed out that the underground research centers of Nazi Germany were gigantic feats of construction, containing wind tunnels, machine shops, assembly plants, launching pads, supply dumps and accommodation for all who worked there, including adjoining camps for slaves \u2014 and yet very few people knew that they existed.\"But, while tales of a secret Nazi base in Antarctica may appear plausible to some, the idea that a warm water location at the South Pole has remained undiscovered and no one has escaped or deserted the place in more than 50 years stretched belief to the breaking point in years past.But with the new revelations of 60-70 degree temperature water, magnetic anomalies suggesting the possibility of a hidden city or base and the obvious back out taking place concerning current events at the pole, the idea of a secret base is no longer so far fetched.Rumors began to circulate that whilst Germany had been defeated, a selection of military personnel and scientists had fled the fatherland as allied troops swept across mainland Europe, and had established themselves at a secret base on the Antarctic continent, from where they continued to develop their advanced aircraft technology.Furthermore, it is interesting to note that at the end of the war, the allies determined that there were 250,000 Germans unaccounted for \u2014 even taking into account casualties and deaths. Huge Discovery: Nazi Maps and Documents to Agartha Confirm the Hollow Earth Accounts Could Neu Schwabenland have been a permanently manned German base at that time? The brackish water of the warm (30 degrees) lakes virtually confirmed that all had an outlet to the sea and would thus have been a haven for U-boats. The two ice-free mountain ranges in Neu Schwabenland presented no worse an underground tunneling project for Organization Todt than anything they had encountered and overcome in Norway.The Germans were the world's experts at building and inhabiting underground metropolis.At the end of the war the United States gave anything concerning Ohrdruf a top secret classification for 100 years upwards. The fact that there had been substantial underground workings there, and Ohrdruf was the location of the last Redoubt, was concealed absolutely. Fortunately for researchers, in 1962 the DDR had taken sworn depositions from all local residents during an investigation into wartime Ohrdruf, and upon the reunification of the two Germanys in 1989, these documents became available to all and sundry at Arnstadt municipal archive.From the Arnstadt documents it is clear that the Charite Anlage unit operated in a three-story underground bunker with floors 70 by 20 meters.When working, the device emitted some kind of energy field which shut down all electrical equipment and non-diesel engines within a range of about eight miles.For this reason, even though Ohrdruf was crawling with SS, it was never photographed from the air nor bombed. Declassified USAF documents dated early 1945 admit the existence of an unknown energy field over Frankfurt/Main \"and other locations\" which \"fantastic though it may appear\" were able to \"interfere with our aircraft engines at 30,000 feet.\"Ohrdruf rebuilt below Neu Schwabenland during the last two years of the war would not have been difficult, and since Charite Anlage had the highest priority of anything in the Third Reich, it seems likely that it must have been.Such a base would have been impregnable, for the suggestion is that the force-field worked in various ways favorable to the occupants. Scary Secrets of the Third Reich's Base in Antarctica A remarkable event occurred in 1999, but only specialists paid adequate attention to it.A research expedition discovered a virus in Antarctica; at that, neither people nor animals had immunity to the virus. After all, Antarctica is far away, for this very reason the virus cannot be dangerous for the rest of the planet, especially since the dangerous discovery was deep in the permafrost.However, scientists say that against the background of a global warming threatening the Earth, the unknown virus can cause an awful catastrophe on the planet.Expert Tom Starmerue from the University of New York also shares the pessimistic forecasts of his colleagues.\"We don't know what the mankind will face in the South Pole in the nearest time due to the global warming. It is not ruled out that an unbelievable catastrophe may break out. \"Viruses protected with a protein cover survive even in the permafrost; as soon as the temperature gets warmer they will immediately start reproducing.\"American scientists treated the Antarctica discovery very seriously and even organized a special expedition that currently tests the ice for unknown viruses in order to develop an antidote in good time.What is the source of the virus in Antarctica where only penguins can survive in the ice? There is no answer to the question, specialists are at a loss. However, several theories concerning the problem have been put forward.A majority of scientists are inclined to believe that prehistoric forms of life probably survived in the permafrost. But some specialists blame bonzes of the Third Reich for delivery of a secretly developed bacteriological weapon to Antarctica. And this theory arose not in a vacuum. It is known that already in 1938 Nazis suddenly became interested in Antarctica, they organized two expeditions to the area in 1938-1939.At first, planes of the Third Reich took detailed pictures of unexplored territories and then they dropped several thousands of metal pennons with swastika there. The whole of the explored territory was called Neuschwabenland and was considered a part of the Third Reich.After the expedition, Captain Ritscher reported to Field-Marshal G\u00f6ring:\"The planes dropped the pennons 25 kilometers apart; we covered the area of about 8.600 thousand square meters. 350 thousand square meters of them were photographed.\"In 1943, Grand Admiral Karl D\u00f6nitz dropped a remarkable phrase:\"Germany's submarine fleet is proud that it created an unassailable fortress for the F\u00fchrer on the other end of the world.\"It highly likely means that Nazis were building a secret base in Antarctica within 1938-1943.Submarines were mostly used for transportation of necessary freight to the place.As specialists for the Third Reich wrote, at the end of WWII the submarines were relieved of their torpedo arms in the port of Kiel and then were loaded with containers with different goods. The submarines also received passengers whose faces were hidden behind surgical bands.Wilhelm Bernhard was commander of one of the submarines, U-530; the submarine left the port of Kiel on April 13, 1945. When it reached the shores of Antarctica, 16 members from the crew built an ice cave and put boxes into the cave; it was allegedly said that the boxes contained relics of the Third Reich, including Hitler's documents and personal stuff. The operation was code named Valkyrie-2.When the operation was over on July 10, 1945, the submarine U-530 entered the Argentinean port of Mar-del-Plata and surrendered to the authorities.It is also supposed that another submarine from the formation, U-977, under the command of Heinz Sch\u00e4ffer delivered the remains of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun to Neuschwabenland. It followed the route of the U-530 submarine and called at Antarctica. The submarine arrived in Mar-del-Plata on August 17, 1945.But the version of Wilhelm Bernhard and Heinz Sch\u00e4ffer saying that the submarines delivered relics to the Antarctica shores (both captains told it at the interrogations held by the American and British intelligence services) seems rather dubious. It is unlikely that the serious operation was designed only for the sake of delivery of the Third Reich documents and relics.Later, special services seized a confidential letter of Captain Sch\u00e4ffer to his friend, Captain Wilhelm Bernhard who obviously planned to publish his memoirs.The letter was dated with June 1, 1983.It runs as follows: \"Dear Willy,I was thinking if it is reasonable to publish your manuscript concerning the U-530. The three submarines that took part in that operation (U-977, U-530 and U-465) are currently at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean. Isn't it better to leave them there? My old friend, think about it! Think please how then my book will look when you publish your memoirs (after, WWII Heinz Sch\u00e4ffer wrote a book named \"U-977\").We all made an oath to keep the secret; we did nothing wrong, we just obeyed the orders and fought for our loved Germany and its survival. Please think again: isn't it better to picture everything as a fable? What results do you plan to achieve with your revelations? Think about it, please.\" Even 40 years after the events, Heinz insisted that Bernhard mustn't say the truth. Is it possible that the submarines delivered something more dangerous to the continent, not Hitler's documents?Could it be the bacteriological weapon traces of which were discovered in Antarctica as unknown viruses in the permafrost last year? NEUBERLIN If you had been a Wehrmacht soldier at the bombed-out railroad station in Poltava, a city in the Ukraine, during the summer of 1942, you may have seen a very strange-looking military unit on the march, heading for a waiting passenger train.The unit consisted of women, all of them blond and blue-eyed, between the ages of 17 and 24, tall and slender, their sensational figures encased in striking sky-blue uniforms.Each woman wore an Italian-style garrison cap, an A-line skirt with the hem below the knee, and a form-fitting jacket with the insignia of the SS. You might have thought the SS had recruited a platoon of high-class call girls, but the truth was far stranger than that. You would have been looking at Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS Heinrich Himmler's latest brainstorm - the Antarktische Siedlungnsfrauen [Antarctic Settlement Women or ASF].The story actually begins in 1938, when the German seaplane carrier Schwabenland sailed across the South Atlantic, bound for Queen Maud's Land in Antarctica.According to Russian ufologist Konstantin Ivanenko,\"The Schwabenland sailed to Antarctica, commanded by Albert Richter, a veteran of cold-weather operations.\"The Richter expedition's scientists used their large Dornier seaplanes to explore the polar wastes, emulating Admiral Richard E. Byrd's efforts a decade earlier.\"The German scientists discovered ice-free lakes (heated by underground volcanic features) and were able to land on them. It is widely believed that the Schwabenland's expedition was aimed at scouting out a secret base of operations.\"A German base was established in the Muhlig-Hofmann Mountains, just inland from the Princess Astrid Coast. The area was renamed Neuschwabenland (New Swabia) and \"the base was known only as Station 211.From the movie Schindler's List, people have gotten the idea that killing Jews was the Nazis' main concern. But in actual fact, Hitler and the SS were just as ruthless with the rest of the population in their eastern European empire, thinking nothing of shuffling large numbers of people around in their quest for a more perfect Aryan race.This shuffle was accomplished by a little-known office of the SS called the Rasse und Siedlungshauptamt (German for Race and Settlement Bureau) or RuSHA. In the Ukraine alone, RuSHA drafted 500,000 women for forced labor in the munitions factories of Nazi Germany.It was RuSHA which selected women for Himmler's unit of Antarktische Siedlungsfrauen (Antarctic Settlement Women) About half of the \"recruits\" were Volksdeutsch-ethnic Germans whose ancestors had settled in the Ukraine in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries. The others were native Ukrainians whom RuSHA had \"upgraded\" to full Aryans.This process was called Eindeutschung (Germanization).According to Ivanenko,\"There is increased popularity for the idea of a 'German-Slavonic Antarctic Reich.' It is said that 10,000 of the 'racially most pure' Ukrainians, out of half a million deported in 1942 by Martin Bormann, were transported to the German Antarctic bases during World War II, in the proportion of four Ukrainian women to one German man.\"If true, this would mean that Himmler transferred 2,500 Waffen-SS soldiers, who had proven themselves in combat on the Russian front, to Station 211 - now Neuschwabenland - in Antarctica. This may be the source of the myth of the \"Last SS Battalion.\"An ASF training camp was set up in Estonia, on a peninsula near Ristna on Hiiumaa Island in the Baltic Sea. It was a combination finishing school and boot camp, where the ladies took lessons in charm and housekeeping along with their courses in polar survival. Himmler kept the camp's existence a closely-guarded secret. For \"unhappy campers,\" the only escape consisted of a one-way train ticket to Auschwitz.(There is one known instance of an ASF \"deserter.\" In 1943, Auschwitz guard Irma Griese, 22, the off-and-on girl friend of Dr. Josef Mengele , took to wearing a sky-blue ASF uniform, which she had scavenged from a pile of inmate clothing. Griese was hanged in 1946 for war crimes. The uniform's original owner must have had serious second thoughts about a permanent move to Antarctica).The failure of Grossadmiral Karl D\u00f6nitz's U-boat offensive by May 1943 freed up dozens of \"milk cow\" U- boats. These were large submarines, almost as big as tramp steamers, which D\u00f6nitz had used to supply his U- boat \"wolf packs\" in remote seas of the world. Himmler now put them to work carting supplies and personnel to Antarctica.Himmler's rationale for sending thousands of settlers to Antarctica can only be understood within the context of his mystic beliefs. As a result of his youthful reading of New Age books, his association with the occultist Dr. Friedrich Wichtl, and his membership in the Artamen, Himmler became a believer in the Hindu concept of world-ages or yugas. He believed that the current age, or Kali Yuga, would end in a global cataclysm, thereby giving birth to a new world-age called the Satya Yuga.By sending a Nazi colony to Antarctica, Himmler was ensuring that a remnant of the \"pure Aryan race\" would survive the coming cataclysm with its society and culture intact. They would then take possession of Antarctica when the cataclysm melted the south polar ice cap.According to believers, the Neuschwabenland colony survived not only the end of World War II, but a full on battle with the 3,500 Marines and aircraft of Operation High Jump .In 2003 Ivanenko wrote:\"The total population of Nazis in Antarctica now exceeds two million and that many of them have undergone plastic surgery in order to move about with greater ease through South America and conduct all manner of business transactions.\"He called the Antarctic Reich,\"one of the most militarily powerful states in the world because it can destroy the USA several times over with its submarine-based nuclear missiles, remaining itself invulnerable to U.S. nuclear strikes because of the two-mile-thick ice shield.\"Further, he claims that the city of Neu Berlin, the colony's capital, sprawls through \"narrow sub-glacial tunnels\" under an unnamed mountain range, heated by \"volcanic vents.\"The ufologist also makes the claim that Neu Berlin adjoins:\"the prehistoric ruins of Kadath, which may have been built by settlers from the lost continent of Atlantis well over 100,000 years ago.\"Still other fringe researchers claim that the actual ruins of Atlantis have been found \u2014 and possibly reoccupied \u2014 under the Antarctic ice. Some say that Atlantis is located near one of the 70 or so warm water lakes that have been discovered miles beneath the Polar Ice Sheet, such as Lake Vostok near the Russian base at the Pole of Inaccessibility.Another of the oft made claims about Neuberlin is that the city has an Alien Quarter, where Pleiadians , Zeta Reticulans , Reptoids , Men In Black , Aldebarani and other visitors from the stars dwell. As we have seen, the Nazis were working on some very advanced aircraft, some of which may have been capable of leaving the earth's atmosphere.Some researchers are convinced that the Nazis did indeed make it to the moon , and even Mars . Could they have made contact with space aliens once they left the earth? Or, could their rockets, foo-fighters and disk aircraft have attracted aliens to visit them?A claim floats around in modern U.F.O. lore that an extraterrestrial craft with anti-gravity propulsion crashed in the Schwarzwald in the summer 1936, and was recovered by the Nazis who back-engineered it, thus explaining their flying saucer program. You can read more about Nazi UFOs here . This parallels stories of a similarly recovered crashed \"saucer\" near Roswell , New Mexico in 1947, the American back-engineering of which supposedly led to the discovery of the transistor (patented by Bell Laboratories the following year), fiber-optics and other exotic technologies.Ivanenko reported that talk about the Antarctic Reich is \"becoming more and more popular\" in Russia, Poland, the Ukraine, Belarus and other countries in eastern Europe.He writes:\"In the May 10, 2003 issue of the (newspaper) 'Frankfurter Allgemeine', Polish journalist A. Stagjuk criticized Poland's decision to send troops to Iraq\" to assist with the Allied occupation.\"At the end, he said, 'The next Polish government will sign a treaty with Antarctica and declare war on the USA.'\"Ivanenko added that Stagjuk's words were broadcast on the shortwave radio station Deutsche Welle the same week.\"Some analysts compared this sentence to famous code phrases which started wars in the Twentieth Century, such as 'Over all of Spain, the sky is cloudless' in 1936, and 'Climb Mount Niitaka' in 1941.\"(\"Climb Mount Niitaka\" was the signal Admiral Yamamoto sent to Kido Butai, the Imperial Japanese Navy's fleet, to begin the attack on Pearl Harbor.)It is strange to think of a large population living under the ice of Antarctica, totally divorced from the \"mainstream\" world.Then again, there are Jivaro indigenous people living on Lago de Yanayacu (lake), less than 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Iquitos, Peru, who have never heard of Courtney Love.So, is there a city under the ice inhabited by the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of the original SS settlers?Or is it just an urban legend stemming from the chaotic conditions that prevailed in Europe during World War II?Some day we may know for certain.

The programme, Just A Girl, depicts an 11-year-old\u2019s struggle to get hormones that stunt puberty, making it easier to have sex-change surgery in the future. \nOne mother, writing on the Mumsnet website, said her daughter had become worried after seeing the video. She said her girl, who likes wearing boys\u2019 clothes and playing football, had \u2018asked me, anxiously, if that means she was a boy\u2019. \nTory MP Peter Bone said: \u2018It beggars belief that the BBC is making this programme freely available to children as young as six. I entirely share the anger of parents who just want to let children be children. \n\u2018It is completely inappropriate for such material to be on the CBBC website and I shall be writing to BBC bosses to demand they take it down as soon as possible.\u2019 \nFormer Culture Secretary Maria Miller voiced her concerns over the BBC tackling the subject in \u2018an age-appropriate way\u2019, saying such issues should be raised \u2018where children can have support from parents\u2019. \nAnd Tory MP Julian Brazier said: \u2018This programme is very disappointing and inappropriate. Children are very impressionable and this is going to confuse and worry them.\u2019 \nFamily campaigner Norman Wells said: \u2018It is irresponsible of the BBC to introduce impressionable children as young as six to the idea that they can choose to be something other than their biological sex.\u2019 \nJust A Girl is the fictional video diary of a child who calls herself \u2018Amy\u2019 and dresses as a girl. It is hosted on the CBBC website, aimed at children aged between six and 12. \nIn the half-hour programme, Amy \u2013 played by an actress \u2013 reveals she was born a boy called Ben but has already started using puberty-halting drugs. \nSuch hypothalamic blockers provoked a furore two years ago when The Mail on Sunday revealed an NHS clinic was willing to give them to children as young as nine. \nCritics cited research claiming that most teenagers confused about their gender never go through with surgery, with many realising they are gay. The BBC row comes amid growing controversy over gender issues, fuelled by a number of high-profile cases. In one, a Christian couple were threatened with having their 14-year-old daughter taken away because they oppose her plans to become a boy. \nIn another, a seven-year-old boy was ordered to be removed from his mother\u2019s care as \u2018she was raising him as female\u2019, causing him \u2018a great deal of emotional harm\u2019. \nIn Just A Girl, Amy says: \u2018When I was born, Mum said Dad was so pleased that he had a boy to take to the football. But Mum knew I was different. She realised early on that I was born in the wrong body.\u2019 \nShe adds: \u2018My Mum supported me when I did a PowerPoint presentation to my class about transitioning and that I wasn\u2019t going to come to school in boys\u2019 clothes any more, but girls\u2019 clothes. I wasn\u2019t Ben, I was Amy.\u2019 \nLater Amy is shown telling a friend, Josh \u2013 a boy who wants to be recognised as a girl \u2013 that she is on hormone blockers, saying it took \u2018ages\u2019 to get them after \u2018loads of tests and talks at the clinic\u2019. \u2018Once they realised I was trans for real, [I] got them,\u2019 she says. In another entry, Amy tells viewers she has developed a crush on a boy called Liam, but confides: \u2018Liam thinks I\u2019m just a girl, but I\u2019m not. I\u2019m trans. And what\u2019s he going to say if he finds out? Stop being my friend? Why? I\u2019m still me, aren\u2019t I?\u2019 \nChild psychotherapist Dr Dilys Daws said the programme could confuse children. She said that, while it was natural for youngsters to wonder what it would be like to be the opposite sex, the BBC was irresponsible to feature the \u2018extreme\u2019 step of gender change for six-year-olds because they were too young to grapple with such issues. \nThe programme generated hundreds of comments on Mumsnet. \nOne mother, who said her seven-year-old had watched the show, asked: \u2018Am I being unreasonable to think this is an inappropriate topic for a young age group?\u2019 \nAnother replied: \u2018Don\u2019t think this is remotely suitable for a seven-year-old. To start suggesting that children can be transgender when they\u2019re far too young to actually have a gender is reckless and damaging. A small boy who is told that he can become a girl may take this as meaning that sex changes are possible, that sometime in the future he\u2019ll wake up with a girl\u2019s body.\u2019 \nAnother user added: \u2018I don\u2019t think hormone therapy should be normalised any more than 12-year-olds drinking or doing recreational drugs should be normalised.\u2019 \nOther critics slammed the BBC. Mr Wells, director of the Family Education Trust, said: \u2018The more we promote the idea that a boy can be born into a girl\u2019s body and a girl can be born into a boy\u2019s body, and that drugs and surgery can put things right, the more children will become utterly confused. Respecting and preserving a child\u2019s birth sex should be seen as a child protection issue.\u2019 \nBut some parents on Mumsnet were more positive. One wrote: \u2018I don\u2019t believe there is \u201ctoo young\u201d for stuff like this. The earlier you teach your children that everyone is different and that nobody is \u201cnormal\u201d the better.\u2019 \nDr Polly Carmichael, a clinical psychologist specialising in transgender children, said: \u2018Raising awareness of these issues is the best way to challenge stigma and discrimination associated with identity issues. Programmes like Just A Girl can contribute to a healthy and informed public discussion.\u2019 \nThe BBC said: \u2018Just A Girl is about a fictional transgender character trying to make sense of the world, deal with bullying and work out how to keep her friends, which are universal themes that many children relate to, and which has had a positive response from our audience. \n\u2018CBBC aims to reflect true life, providing content that mirrors the lives of as many UK children as possible.\u2019"}, "y_dict": {"0": "FAKE", "1": "FAKE", "2": "REAL", "3": "FAKE", "4": "REAL", "5": "FAKE", "6":
